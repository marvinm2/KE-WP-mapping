## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-07

### 🏗️ Major Architecture Refactoring

#### Added
- **Blueprint Architecture**: Modular application structure with separate blueprints for auth, API, admin, and main routes
- **Application Factory Pattern**: `create_app()` function for flexible application instantiation
- **Dependency Injection Container**: `ServiceContainer` class for managing application services
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-aware configuration classes (Development, Production, Testing)
- **Centralized Error Handling**: `error_handlers.py` with custom exception classes and consistent error responses
- **Health Monitoring System**: `/health` endpoint with comprehensive system status reporting
- **Enhanced Security**: CSRF protection, input validation, and sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API throttling with different limits for different endpoint types
- **Logging Framework**: Structured logging with different levels and contexts

#### Changed
- **Monolithic Structure → Blueprint Architecture**: Split 758-line `app.py` into focused modules (147 lines main app)
- **Hardcoded Configuration → Environment Management**: Dynamic configuration based on environment variables
- **Global Variables → Service Injection**: Clean dependency management with singleton patterns
- **Scattered Error Handling → Centralized System**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints
- **Basic Health Check → Comprehensive Monitoring**: Detailed system and service health reporting

#### Technical Improvements
- **Code Reduction**: 80% reduction in main application file size
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with single-responsibility modules
- **Testability**: Dependency injection enables comprehensive unit testing
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new features through blueprint system
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and service monitoring
