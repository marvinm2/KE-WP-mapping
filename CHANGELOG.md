- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API throttling with different limits for different endpoint types
- **Logging Framework**: Structured logging with different levels and contexts

#### Changed
- **Monolithic Structure ‚Üí Blueprint Architecture**: Split 758-line `app.py` into focused modules (147 lines main app)
- **Hardcoded Configuration ‚Üí Environment Management**: Dynamic configuration based on environment variables
- **Global Variables ‚Üí Service Injection**: Clean dependency management with singleton patterns
- **Scattered Error Handling ‚Üí Centralized System**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints
- **Basic Health Check ‚Üí Comprehensive Monitoring**: Detailed system and service health reporting

#### Technical Improvements
- **Code Reduction**: 80% reduction in main application file size
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with single-responsibility modules
- **Testability**: Dependency injection enables comprehensive unit testing
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new features through blueprint system
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and service monitoring
