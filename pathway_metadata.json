    "pathwayDescription": "Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a central enzyme in relation to the TCA cycle, as it converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Its activity favours TCA cycle activity. PDH is downregulated by PDH kinase (PDK) and upregulated by PDH phosphatase (PDP). PDK and PDP are respectively down and upregulated in OIS, in particular in the case of the oncogene BRAFV600E (James et al., 2015; Wiley & Campisi, 2016). Due to these regulatory mechanisms, PDH is a crucial mediator of OIS for TCA activity.\n\nMalic enzyme (ME) is another crucial enzyme in the TCA cycle. There appears to be a reciprocal regulation between p53 and ME, mediated through AMPK activation. Downregulation of ME leads to p53-mediated induction of senescence, while upregulation can suppress it (Jiang et al., 2013; Wiley & Campisi, 2016). Because ME uses NAD+/NADP+ and produces NADH/NADPH, downregulation of the enzyme also affects NADPH-dependent mechanisms, including antioxidant defenses. This in turn can cause accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate p53 through AMPK and cause senescence (Wiley & Campisi, 2016).\n\nIn OIS, accumulation of TCA intermediates has been observed, including alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate and malate (Kaplon et al., 2013). Further research showed that increased alpha-ketoglutarate has an effect on transcriptional regulation (Salama et al., 2014).\n\nLipids are also part of the input of the TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation has been observed to increase in OIS (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019).\n\nMalate dehydrogenase (MDH1) also plays an important role in the TCA cycle and is part of the malate-aspartate shuttle. Lower levels of the enzyme were observed in DNA-damage induced and proliferative exhaustion-induced senescent cells. Downregulation of MDH1 also affects the NAD+/NADH ratio, known to be related to senescence. Other enzymes of the malate-aspartate shuttle also affect this ratio, such as the aspartate aminotransferase (GOT1). Factors influencing NAD metabolism in senescence have been addressed in more details in https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP5046"

Upon cell entrance, thiamine undergoes pyrophosphorylation by thiamine pyrophosphokinase (TPK) to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). TPP is the active form of thiamine and serves as a cofactor of transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway in the cytosol. TPP also functions as a cofactor for pyruvate, ketoglutarate and branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenases in the mitochondrion after entrance via TPP transporter encoded by SLC25A19. This pathway was inspired by Chapter 15 (Thiamine Disorders) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361))."

In the NOTCH signaling pathway, mammals have 11 ligands (JAG, DLL, DLK, etc.) and 4 NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1,2,3,4). The pathway is activated by the interaction between a ligand in a ligand expressing cell and a NOTCH receptor in an adjacent, receptor expressing cell.  At this point, proteases (ADAM10 and PSEN1/2) cleave the intracellular domain (NICD) of the NOTCH protein from the extracellular domain (NECD). In the canonical pathway, NICD travels into the nucleus where it forms a transcription complex with other proteins (RBPJ and MAML1,2,3). This transcriptional complex regulates the transcription of downstream canonical target genes, such as HES1 and HEY1. In the non-canonical pathway, otherwise known as RBPJ-independent NOTCH signaling, NOTCH can activate through R-Ras to promote cell adhesion. Alternatively, NOTCH may interact with IKKa in the NF-kB pathway, or LEF1 in the Wnt pathway.While the role that the canonical NOTCH pathway plays in skeletal biology is well understood, our understanding of the role of the non-canonical pathway remains primitive."

VIP induces immune tolerance and inhibits the autoimmune response through different non-excluding mechanisms. First, it induces the generation and differentiation of Th2 cells functions and decrease Th1 cell functions through direct actions on differentiating T cells, or indirectly by regulating antigen presenting cell (APC) functions. As a consequence, the inflammatory and autoimmune responses are impaired, and the anti-helminthic and atopic responses are increased, because the infiltration and activation of neutrophils and macrophages by interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and the production of complement-activating IgG2 antibodies are avoided. Second, VIP impairs the co-stimulatory activity of APCs on effector T cells, inhibiting subsequent clonal expansion. This avoids the inflammatory response and its cytotoxic effect against the target tissue. Third, VIP induces the generation of regulatory T cells that suppress the activation of autoreactive T cells by producing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2). This effect contributes to the maintenance of an anti-inflammatory state and restores immune tolerance. "

Inside cells, iron is stored as ferritin (FT). On the basolateral side, iron leaves the epithelium via a basolateral transporter, SLC40A1 (or IREG1), followed by oxidation through the action of hephaestin (Heph), a membrane-bound ceruloplasmin-like multicopper ferroxidase. Iron-loaded transferrin (Fe2-Tf) binds to the transferrin receptor (TfRC) on the surface of cells. The receptor-transferrin complex, localized in clathrin-coated pits (TTTT), is invaginated and forms endosomes. These specialized endosomes acquire a low internal pH due to the action of a proton pump (not shown). This leads to the dissociation of the iron from transferrin. Iron can be converted into its ferrous form by the metalloreductase STEAP3 and then leave the endosomes via SLC11A2. Apo-transferrin and transferrin receptors recycle to the plasma membrane for reuse. This iron uptake mechanism is found in most cell types, including enterocyte precursor cells. Excess iron can leave at least some cell types via SLC40A1 and can be converted to its ferric form by ceruloplasmin (CP), a non-membrane multicopper ferroxidase. Hereditary hemochromatosis results from mutations in HFE. HFE forms a heterodimer with \u03b22-microglobulin, and some mutations that lead to hemochromatosis interrupt this interaction and thus lead to excess iron accumulation. Defects in a second transferrin receptor, TfR2, have recently been implicated in type 3 hemochromatosis. Hepcidin (HAMP) modulates cellular iron export through ferroportin (SLC40A1) by internalizing it into vesicles when the iron concentration is high. HFE, TfR2 and HJV are Hepcidin regulators which are mutated in hereditary hemochromatosis."

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP2355",
    "pathwayDescription": "Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide secreted abundantly in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex and cerebellum in the central nervous system. It is also expressed in adrenal gland, placenta, testis, spleen, gut, thymus and skin. CRH is the principal mediator of endocrine stress response. CRH also plays a significant role in inflammatory responses, hemodynamic actions, stromal cell decidualization during estrus cycle, implantation of blastocyst, maintenance of pregnancy, onset of labor  and neuroprotection. Excess secretion of CRH during severe depression and its association with increased levels of cortisol have been observed. CRH has also been reported to be involved in anxiety disorders, anorexia nervosa. Decrease in cortical CRH content has been observed in Alzheimer's disease  and Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe actions of CRH are mediated through class II/secretin-like family type of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) called the CRH receptors (CRHR). CRH is a high affinity ligand of CRHR1 and also binds to CRHR2 but with lower affinity. CRH receptors do not have any intrinsic kinase activity and transduce the signal via the heterotrimeric G-proteins. The CRH receptors are rapidly desensitized by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) and \u00ce\u00b2-arrestin mechanisms in the presence of high concentrations of CRH. Binding of CRH to CRH receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor by activating it. This further activates G\u00ce\u00b1-subunit and its subsequent dissociation from the G\u00ce\u00b2\u00ce\u00b3 dimer. CRH receptors on interaction with G\u00ce\u00b1-subunit of different G-proteins such as G\u00ce\u00b1s, G\u00ce\u00b1i/o, G\u00ce\u00b1q/11 activate numerous downstream signaling cascades and result in the induction of various cellular responses. The pathways that are activated upon CRH stimulation are: Adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA, PLC/PKC, ERK/MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B. \n\nCRH binding to CRHR1 couples G-stimulatory (Gs) protein which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors like cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which in turn increases the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and \u00ce\u00b2-endorphin. ACTH, in turn, stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids from adrenal glands and thereby mediates changes associated with stress response. CREB also regulates genes containing the Ca2+/cAMP response element such as FOS. The activation of cAMP by CRH induces the mRNA expression and transcription of orphan nuclear receptors NR4A1 and NR4A2, which in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of POMC. Activation of cAMP/PKA can also induce the expression of enzymes involved in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol production. The biological functions of CRH are also mediated by MAPK family, in particular MAPK1/3 and MAPK14. MAPK1/3 mediates activation of transcription factors NR4A1 and NR4A2 and induction of POMC in corticotrophs. MAPK14 is involved in CRH-induced inhibition of IL-18 expression in human keratinocytes. The CRHR1/PKA/ERK signaling activate the transcription factors - ELK1, SP1 and TFAP2A. SP1 and TFAP2A up-regulates the expression of ADRBK2, which causes the desensitization of CRHR1 receptors.\n\nThe PLC/PKC pathway is activated by coupling of the CRH receptors to the G\u00ce\u00b1q/11 proteins. This cascade stimulates the formation of IP3 and contributes to the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Calcium is involved in the transcription regulation of FOS as well as NR4A1 and NR4A2 through CAMK2A. PLC/PKC is involved in the activation of AP-1 complex and subsequent transcriptional regulation of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c KRT1, KRT14 and IVL.

CCK, CCK2R, and CB1R have all been known to have substantial effects on anxiety and other mood disorders, and the PV+ interneurons have also been shown to be involved i na variety of cognitive functions. However,  In PV+ basket cells and CCK+ basket cells, the CCK2 receptor uses different pathways to exert different effects on the two types of basket cells. For CCK+ basket cells, CCK2 receptors in neighboring pyramidal cells act through the Gq pathway to form endocannabinoids, which, through the cannabinoid receptor type 1 on the CCK+ basket cell, inhibit the release of the neurotransmitter GABA. In contrast, for PV+ basket cells, CCK2 receptors act through the pertussin-toxin sensitive Gi pathway to regulate the intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a through ryanodine receptors. This pathway ultimately leads to activation of a non-selective cationic conductance to depolarize the PV+ basket cells."

    "pathwayDescription": "Wide-ranging correlations are found between the initial physical features of radiation exposure and the possibility of biological consequences. These persist even with the chain of physical, chemical and biological processes that eliminate the majority of the early damage.\n\nIonizing radiations (IRs) generate hundreds of different simple chemical products in DNA as well multitudes of clustered combinations. The simple products, including single-strand breaks (SSBs), tend to correlate poorly with biological effectiveness. However, when IR produce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA it comes a large rise in relative biological response to cellular damage. In general terms, IRs produce a wide variety of DNA lesions and DSBs are considered to be the major actor responsible for cell death. If unrepaired or improperly repaired, DSBs contribute to chromosomal aberrations, which may lead to human disorders including cancer. The accurate preservation of chromosome continuity in human cells during either DNA replication or repair is critical for preventing the conversion of normal cells to an oncogenic status.\n\nThe production of DSBs can be quantified by biochemical techniques, e.g., pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and cell imaging, either globally or damage specific, through immunostaining of marker proteins or recruitment of fluorescent proteins to the DNA breaks.\n\nIn vertebrate cells, the elimination of DSBs with minimal nucleotide sequence change involves the spatiotemporal orchestration of an apparently endless number of proteins ranging, according to their action, from the nucleotide level to nucleosome organization and chromosome architecture. DSBs trigger a multitude of post-translational modifications that alter both, catalytic activities and the specificity of protein interactions including: phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, followed by the turnaround of these changes as repair has been completed.\n\nIn mammalian cells, the formation of DSBs initiates a massive global cellular response, either checkpoint signaling and repair or cell death (apoptosis). A major role is that of the MRN (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1) complex binding to DSBs and facilitating the activation of ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) protein, a key PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) related kinase in the DNA damage response (DDR). At the break site, ATM autophosphorylates, allowing its activation and the following phosphorylation of several substrates in the surrounding chromatin.\nThe following pathway diagrams the early events of the cellular response after DSBs by IR through the activation of ATM in human cells."

As an alternative, a so called 'backdoor pathway', which can create dihydrotestosterone (DHT), skipping testosterone.

Notably, PARP9 and PARP14 have opposing roles in macrophages, with PARP9 promoting anti-inflammatory effects and PARP14 enhancing proinflammatory responses, thus regulating macrophage activation. Additionally, the expression of PARP9 is controlled by the IFN\u03b3-JAK2/STAT1-IRF1 signaling pathway, which is essential for the survival of cancer cells in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with an active host inflammatory response.\n\n*Positive regulation*\nIn macrophages, the phosphorylation of STAT6 induced by IL-4 and the subsequent activation of anti-inflammatory genes depend on the activation of PARP14, which likely involves PARP14-mediated ADP-ribosylation of STAT6. The role of PARP14 in the ADP-ribosylation of STAT6 for gene activation presents a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the progression of allergic airway diseases.\n\nPARP1 positively influences STAT6-dependent transcriptional activation. Reduced PARP1 levels lead to decreased STAT6 protein stability, resulting in lowered IL-5 expression in murine splenocytes. Moreover, excessive activation of PARP1, causing NAD+ depletion, is believed to contribute to the development of various cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nIn a phenylephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy model, PARP1 and its enzymatic activity help retain phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus, extending its transcriptional activity independent of JAK2, which contributes to the hypertrophy phenotype.\n\nPARP9, in association with its binding partner DTX3L, is involved in STAT1-mediated interferon signaling. The PARP9/DTX3L complex is a key factor regulating STAT1 transcriptional activity and enhances the host defense response following viral infection. In DLBCL, PARP9 stimulates the phosphorylation of both STAT1 isoforms, particularly promoting the nuclear accumulation of the transcriptionally repressive STAT1\u03b2 isoform. PARP9, together with STAT1\u03b2, inhibits the expression of the tumor suppressor IRF1, while enhancing the expression of proto-oncogenes such as IRF2 and BCL6. In this context, PARP9 suppresses the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic IFN\u03b3-STAT1-IRF1-p53 pathway, thereby promoting cell proliferation and survival in DLBCL.\n\n*Negative regulation*\n\nViral infection triggers the expression of PARP11 (ARTD11), which mono-ADP-ribosylates the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP. This modification leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1, ultimately suppressing the IFN antiviral signaling pathway.\n\nIn response to influenza A viral infection, PARP1 transiently co-localizes with HA in the cytoplasm, mediating the degradation of IFNAR1 in an ADP-ribosylation-dependent manner.\n\nIn ovarian, lung, and colon cancer cell lines, PARP1 downregulates PD-L1 expression by ADP-ribosylating STAT3, which decreases its phosphorylation. This contrasts with the positive regulation of STAT3 described earlier, highlighting the context-dependent regulation of STAT3 by PARP1."

The pathways produce the main steroid hormones in humans, namely progestogen, corticosteroids, androgens and estrogens. \nThe classical pathway produces androgen, a synthetic steroid hormone that regulates sexual development and maintenance of male sex organs by binding to androgen receptors.

    "pathwayDescription": "The pentose phosphate pathway is an important route for glucose oxidation. This pathway is divided over 2 different branches; the non-oxidative and the oxidative. The oxidative branch supports the regeneration of reduced NADPH, while converting glucose-6-phosphate into ribulose-5-phosphate and CO2 in an unidirectional way. This branch is also linked to glycolysis at the glucose-6-phosphate level, while the non-oxidative branch is linked to glycolysis in a bidirectional way, depending on the availability of the intermediates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. This non-oxidative branch converts pentose phosphates into phosphorylated ketones and aldoses (Almeida et al., 2018). During this process, ribose-5-phosphate is produced, which is an important precursor for nucleotide synthesis. The regeneration of the NADPH by the oxidative branch, is regulated by the NADP+/NADPH ratio. When this ratio is lower, due to lower levels of NADPH, the regeneration of NADPH is stimulated in order to maintain the balance (Clement et al., 2019). In case of senescence, OIS heightens this ratio, while proliferative exhaustion-induced senescence lowers this ratio. Furthermore, p53 lowers glycolysis by lowering the level of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. The PPP is also upregulated due to oxidative stress and by conditions of low stress induced by P53, which is symptomatic of PE-induced senescence (Zhang et al., 2016).  Another study by Wu et al. (2017) showed that one of the rate-limiting enzymes, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), is upregulated in OIS, due to which the PPP is also upregulated again.\nMetabolic hallmarks of cellular senescence: highlighting the role of intracellular pathways in various senescent phenotypes, by Birgit Veldman, was also used as a reference.\n\n"

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP1403",
    "pathwayDescription": "AMPK signaling pathway, a fuel sensor and regulator, promotes ATP-producing and inhibits ATP-consuming pathways in various tissues. AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of alpha-catalytic and beta and gamma-regulatory subunits. Humans and rodents have two alpha and beta and three gamma isoforms; some genes are subject to alternative splicing increasing the range of possible heterotrimer combinations. Cellular stresses that inhibit ATP production or increase its consumption change the AMP:ATP ratio and activate the pathway. AMPK activation by AMP is not completely understood; the current model states that binding of AMP to the gamma subunit leads to conformational changes that allosterically activate AMPK and render phosphorylated-Thr172 unavailable for inhibitory dephosphorylation. ATP antagonizes the effect of AMP; both AMP and ATP bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the Bateman (CBS) domains of the gamma subunit. The upstream kinase, known as Lkb1, is a complex of one catalytic and two regulatory subunits; Lkb1 is believed to be 'constitutively active'. In certain cell types, Thr172 can be phosphorylated by calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CAmKK), in turn activated by calcium. A well known role of AMPK is in the regulation of lipid metabolism; it stimulates fatty acids oxidation and inhibits their synthesis. Phosphorylation by AMPK inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and results in reduced levels of malonyl-CoA product. Malonyl CoA is a substrate in the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and fatty acids elongation. Importantly, it is also an inhibitor of the carnitine palmitoyl transferase I, required for the transfer of primed cytosolic fatty acids into the mitochondrion where they can undergo degradative beta-oxidation. AMPK inhibits mTOR signaling pathway by activating Tsc2 and downstream of Tsc2 by inhibiting Raptor component of mTOR complex 1 [note that this effect is opposite to Tsc2 phosphorylation and inactivation by PI3K-Akt signaling downstream of insulin]. AMPK is also involved in promoting glucose uptake and utilization and integrates adipokynes and hormonal signals in both the hypothalamus and the periphery with potential impact on energy expenditure and uptake by molecular mechanisms that remain to be established. Due to its roles in fuel regulation, the AMPK pathway is regarded as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes type II, obesity and metabolic syndrome. As a note, drugs used in the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes can activate AMPK.\n\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. The kinase is activated in response to stresses that deplete cellular ATP supplies such as low glucose, hypoxia, ischemia and heat shock. It exists as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic \u03b1 subunit and regulatory \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits. Binding of AMP to the \u03b3 subunit allosterically activates the complex, making it a more attractive substrate for its major upstream AMPK kinase, LKB1. Several studies indicate that signaling through adiponectin, leptin and CAMKK\u03b2 may also be important in activating AMPK.\n\nAs a cellular energy sensor responding to low ATP levels, AMPK activation positively regulates signaling pathways that replenish cellular ATP supplies. For example, activation of AMPK enhances both the transcription and translocation of GLUT4, resulting in an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, it also stimulates catabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis via inhibition of ACC and activation of PFK2. AMPK negatively regulates several proteins central to ATP consuming processes such as TORC2, glycogen synthase, SREBP-1 and TSC2, resulting in the downregulation or inhibition of gluconeogenesis, glycogen, lipid and protein synthesis. Due to its role as a central regulator of both lipid and glucose metabolism, AMPK is considered to be a key therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1403)."

The alpha6beta4 integrin is a component of Hemidesmosomes (HDs) (3, 4,5). Increased expression of alphaEbeta4 and changes in its distribution is found to be correlated with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor prognosis (6, 7). Although integrin alpha6beta4, can interact with different laminin isoforms, its preferred ligand in the epidermal BM is laminin-5 (8, 9). The beta4 integrin is a large protein and has a cytoplasmic domain of more than 1000 amino acids (10, 11). This domain contains a Na-Ca exchanger (CalX) motif followed by two pairs of type III fibronectin (FNIII) domains separated by a connecting segment (CS). It is found to associate with the intermediate filament system through plectin and BP230, which are components of hemidesmosomes (12,13,14). Interaction of intgrin beta4 with components of hemidesmosomes including plectin, BP230 and BP180 is found to be important in signaling events associated with cell growth, survival, and migration under physiological and pathological conditions.\n\nStudies have shown that beta4 can regulate keratinocyte migration both positively and negatively (15,16,17,18). It is also found to regulate cell survival in keratinocytes in cell culture systems under stress in a PI3K/Akt pathway dependent manner (19,18). However, alpha6beta4 was not found to have any effect on keratinocyte survival in vivo (20, 18, 16). Apart from its effects on keratinocytes, evidence suggests that integrin alpha6beta4 is important in cancer cell invasion (21,22,23,24) and survival (25,26,27,28,16,29). The cancer cell invasion is regulated through a IRS/PI3K dependent process while the effect on carcinoma cell survival in a PI3K/Akt and dependent manner. Activation of the transcription factors NFkappaB and NF-IL6 in a p38Mapk dependent pathway and subsequent activation of IL6 gene expression was shown to be mechanism of alpha6beta4 induced survival of thymocytes and proliferation of thymic epithelial cells (27,30). Integrin alpha6beta4 is also known activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade which is found to be involved in the regulation of cell cycle (31,32,33,34).\nNetPath (http://www.netpath.org) is a collaborative project between PandeyLab at Johns Hopkins University (http://pandeylab.igm.jhmi.edu) and the Institute of Bioinformatics (http://www.ibioinformatics.org).

The chimeric DNAJB1-PRKACA protein has increased kinase activity and is essential for FLC xenograft growth.... a core function of DNAJB1-PRKACA is the phosphorylation and inactivation of salt-inducible kinases (SIKs). This leads to deregulation of the CRTC2 transcriptional coactivator and p300 acetyltransferase, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming and increased global histone acetylation, driving malignant growth. Our studies establish a central oncogenic mechanism of DNAJB1-PRKACA and suggest the potential of targeting CRTC2/p300 in FLC. Notably, these findings link this rare cancer\u2019s signature fusion oncoprotein to more common cancer gene alterations involving STK11 and GNAS, which also function via SIK suppression.\"  Diagram inspired by figure 1H in Gritti, Wan et al.

It is a catalytic cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in critical biological processes (e.g. detoxification by oxygen free radicals, angiogenesis, pigmentation, peptide hormone production, etc.). However, \"free\" copper is harmful for cells because it can generate ROS that leads to cellular damage. Thus, all organisms and cells maintain a tight control of its uptake, trafficking and export. This process is rather intricate and requires an interplay between numerous biomolecules (e.g. proteins, metabolites) that act as copper ions importers (CTR1, CTR2, DMT1, Prp, APP), chaperones (CCS, ATOX1, COX17, COMMD1) and exporters (ATP7A, ATP7B). Copper ions and Cu-independent stimuli (hormone, oxygen, phosphorylation and ubiquination) seem to affect localization and expression of Cu-transporters and chaperones. Potential targets of copper ions seem to be crucial signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, in which copper induces insulin-like effects. Copper dyshomeostasis could be implicated in cancer and a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, prion disease and ALS.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3286)."

    "pathwayDescription": "\"Mechanisms of action of bempedoic acid. In the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, ACSVL1 converts bempedoic acid to bempedoyl-CoA that directly inhibits ACLY. This is a key enzyme responsible for generating acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate from citric acid deriving from mitochondrial TCA cycle. Reduction of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate levels affects fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis as well as gluconeogenesis. In addition, bempedoic free acid activates the AMPK pathway, which downregulates key rate-limiting enzymes of lipid synthesis (ACC and HMGR) and glucose production (PEPCK and G6Pase). In the liver, the combination of ACLY inhibition and AMPK activation by bempedoic acid decreases cholesterol, FFA and glucose synthesis both by reducing precursor substrates and by downregulating key enzyme activities. Through this mechanism, bempedoic acid may improve dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and diabetes. In skeletal muscle, bempedoic acid cannot be activated to bempedoyl-CoA because ACSVL1 is completely absent in this tissue. Thus, this drug does not promote myotoxicity associated with cholesterol synthesis inhibition, as statins can. In the immune cells and in other tissues, AMPK activation by bempedoic acid downregulates MAPK pro-inflammatory pathways leading to decreased cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule synthesis. Through this mechanism, bempedoic acid decreases inflammation, hsCRP levels and may contribute to atherosclerosis and NASH prevention.

    "pathwayDescription": "NF-\u03baB binds to and represses the PARP10 promoter, resulting in transcriptional suppression in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nIn prostate carcinoma resistant to gemcitabine, constitutive activation of NF-\u03baB signaling is crucial, and elevated levels of PARP14 (ARTD8) are associated with poor patient outcomes.\n\nPARP14 plays a key role in cell survival and is essential for sustaining NF-\u03baB signaling. Mechanistically, the reduction in NF-\u03baB signaling is attributed to decreased phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1.\n\nThe canonical NF-\u03baB pathway is activated in response to viral infections. Mechanistically, the binding of 5\u2032-triphosphate-modified RNA to RIG-I complexes enhances its interaction with MAVS, activating the IKK complex, which leads to I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and the release of NF-\u03baB dimers. Interestingly, the catalytically inactive RNA-binding protein PARP13 (ARTD13) restricts the replication of oncogenic viruses by stabilizing the activated RIG-I complex's binding to MAVS, thus enhancing NF-\u03baB signaling. This suggests that PARP13 may play a protective role against malignant transformation and cancer progression.\n\nPARP12 localizes to p62/SQSTM1 foci, and its activity is essential for initiating the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade.\n\nER-stress-induced inflammation and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) are transmitted through ER-associated stress sensors. These sensors significantly contribute to tumor progression and metastasis in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Mechanistically, activated IRE-1\u03b1 recruits TRAF2, which activates the canonical pathway via IKK, leading to the release of NF-\u03baB dimers. Simultaneously, PERK triggers an eIF2\u03b1-dependent reduction in translation, lowering overall I\u03baB levels and shifting the equilibrium from complexed, inactive NF-\u03baB to a free, transiently active form. During ER stress, PARP16, an ER-anchored protein, modifies itself and two stress sensors, IRE-1\u03b1 and PERK. Activation of PARP16 promotes IRE-1\u03b1 and PERK signaling, even in the absence of ER stress, and is crucial for their activity during the UPR.\n\nBoth PARP1 (ARTD1) and its enzymatic activity are linked to increased NF-\u03baB signaling. In TNF\u03b1-stimulated NIH3T3 fibroblasts lacking PARP1, NF-\u03baB target gene expression is suppressed, despite NF-\u03baB being localized in the nucleus. Moreover, LPS treatment of wild-type or PARP1-deficient mice reinforces the involvement of PARP1 in NF-\u03baB's transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, LPS-dependent NF-\u03baB activation in primary murine fibroblasts is driven by the interaction of PARP1 with transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300. This complex formation leads to PARP1 acetylation, enabling the PARP1-CBP-p300 complex to interact with the p50 subunit of NF-\u03baB, thus activating NF-\u03baB signaling and initiating the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, transcription factors, and other inflammatory mediators.\n\nIn non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling, NF-\u03baB2 processing is regulated by NIK, which is downregulated by non-canonical IKK TBK1. In an NF-\u03baB-independent context, TBK1 activates IRF3 in response to viral infections. Notably, TBK1 kinase activity and antiviral response efficacy are negatively regulated by PARP7 (ARTD14/TIPARP)-mediated ADP-ribosylation.\n\nIn HeLa and U2OS cells, PARP10 inhibits IKK complex activation and NF-\u03baB signaling. Mechanistically, PARP10 reduces K63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, which prevents IKK complex assembly and activation.\n\nInspired by Figure 1 and associated description in [Boehi et al.

    "pathwayDescription": "The IL-1 family of cytokines currently consists of 11 members which are encoded by distinct genes and includes IL-1\u00ce\u00b1, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, and the IL-1 Receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The major role of IL-1 type cytokines is to control pro-inflammatory reactions in response to tissue injury - either due to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or Danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which includes IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, plays a crucial role in many auto inflammatory diseases. IL- 1\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 are produced predominantly by macrophages and monocytes, and to a lesser extent by other cell types such as epithelial cells endothelial cells and fibroblasts. IL-1 alpha, is a membrane anchored protein which signals through autocrine or juxtracrine mechanisms where as the soluble IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 acts in a paracrine or systemic manner. Significant progress has been achieved in the study of the signaling events mediated by IL-1 and the processes they control. Involvement of IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 or IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 in host responses to infections caused by intracellular microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as in autoinflammatory diseases makes its signaling components important candidates for drug targetting for these diseases. The two forms of IL-1 (IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2) bind to the same cellular receptor, the Type I IL- 1 receptor (IL-1RI) to induce signaling. Upon receptor engagement, IL-1R1 forms a heterodimer with IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which functions as a co receptor. IL-1RAcP cannot bind directly to IL-1 but is essential for IL-1-mediated signaling. Binding of IL-1 to this receptor complex leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-\u00ce\u00baB through different signaling mechanisms. Two IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 have been implicated in the activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB. IRAK 1 and 2 functions as adapter proteins and protein kinases to transmit downstream signals. It recruits TRAF6 to the IL-1 receptor complex via an interaction with IL-1RAcP. Oligomerization of TRAF6 and subsequent formation of TAK1 and MEKK3 signaling complexes relays the signal via NF-\u00ce\u00baB-inducing kinase (NIK) to two I-kappaB kinases (IKK-1 and -2), leading to NF-kappaB activation. Activation of other mitogen activated protein kinases, including JNKs and p38 MAPK through various MAP2Ks also play important roles in mediating IL-1 responses by activating transcription through the AP-1 transcription factor. The above mentioned signaling events co-operatively induce the expression of IL-1 target genes such as CCL2, IL-8 and IL-6. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical Interleukin-1 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map. Regulation of IL-1 signaling can be brought about by various mechanisms. The IL-1 family member IL-1RA can bind to the IL1-R1 receptor with similar affinity as IL-1\u00ce\u00b1 and \u00ce\u00b2, but is incapable of activating the signaling response. The type II IL-1 receptor can bind to IL-1 alpha and beta but lacks signaling capacity. The naturally occurring 'shed' domains of the extracellular IL-1 receptor chains (IL-1RI, IL-1RII and IL- 1RAcP) also act as inhibitors of IL-1 signaling. In the cell, IL-1R binds to toll- interacting protein (TOLLIP), which results in the inhibition of IRAK1 and by promoting efficient degradation of IL-1R by targeting the internalized receptor to endosomes. Other mechanisms such as p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation of TAB1 which results in the inactivation of TAK1, and expression of genes including MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and Inhibitor of kappa B alpha (NFKBIA) that inhibit IL-1 signaling components also serve as negative regulators of IL-1 signaling.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_1_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Glycolysis is also responsible for increased lactate production by producing pyruvate, along with several other mechanisms including upregulated lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate kinase (PKM), serinolysis and glutaminolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PKM) is responsible for the last conversion step of glycolysis, producing pyruvate. The enzyme is upregulated in replicative senescence and leads to increased TCA activity and oxygen consumption rate (Sabbatinelli et al., 2019). Findings were similar in another study on oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) (D\u00f6rr et al., 2013). PKM is also thought to increase lactate production indirectly (Zwerschke et al., 2003). In parallel, lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) is also upregulated, which leads to this increase in lactate levels in senescent cells. Senescence induced by oncogenes also has an impact on serinolysis and glutaminolysis. These are processes in which serine and glutamine are consumed to produce energy. They usually take place in tumour cells as an alternative source of energy, and produce lactate (among others) as a by-product. It has been found that both processes are increased in OIS, and lead to increases in lactate levels (Mazurek et al., 2001). Such increased levels of lactate lead to several events associated with senescence, such as tumorigenesis, wound healing and evasion from immune responses (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). \n\nThe upregulation of several glycolytic enzymes seems to mediate increased glycolysis in various types of induced senescence. Depending on the stimulus, various proteins and genes influence glycolytic rates. For example, in irradiation-induced senescence, this effect seems to be mediated by AMPK activation and NF-kB signalling (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). Similarly, in OIS, the retinoblastoma protein appears to upregulate glycolytic genes (Nacarelli & Sell, 2017). The very important p53 is known to be a central mediator of senescence, due to its role in cell cycle regulation. It has been found to negatively affect glycolysis (Gu et al., 2018). However it also has an indirect positive effect on it, by activating G6PDH in stressed cells (Jiang et al., 2011). TP53 is therefore thought to have a regulatory role on glycolysis and is interesting in the context of senescence.\n\nWhile most glycolytic enzymes are upregulated (Zwerschke et al., 2003), GAPDH seems to decrease. This may partially be explained by the sensitivity of the enzyme to oxidative stress.\n"

Upon deoxygenation, the resulting hemoglobin S (HbS) molecules polymerize into rigid fibers, driving erythrocyte sickling (clockwise). \n\n(B) Sickled cells cause impaired blood rheology and enhanced adhesion of erythrocytes to neutrophils, platelets, and the endothelium, leading to slowed or obstructed microvascular flow -- called vaso-occlusion.

Oxygenated Hb (Fe\u00b2\u207a) contributes to endothelial dysfunction by consuming nitric oxide (NO) and producing nitrate (NO\u2083\u207b) and methemoglobin (Fe\u00b3\u207a).

    "pathwayDescription": "IL-4 is a glycoprotein which is composed of 129 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 20kDa. IL-4 and IL-13 are produced by CD4+ cells and exhibit significant functional overlap. Both these cytokines play a critical role in the promotion of allergic responses. IL-4 is primarily involved in promoting the differentiation and proliferation of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and the synthesis of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Apart from its role in allergic responses including asthma, IL-4 was also found to regulate retinal progenitor proliferation, rod photoreceptor differentiation, cholinergic and GABAergic amacrine differentiation and neuroprotection and survival. IL-4 was also found to have regulatory effects in a number of neurological diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephelitis. It was also found to relieve inflammatory and neuropathic pain. IL-4 is capable of exerting its biological activities through interaction with two cell surface receptor complexes - Type I IL4 receptor and Type II IL4 Receptor. Both these receptor complexes comprise of a common IL4R\u00ce\u00b1 (CD124) subunit, which is also the functional receptor chain. Type I IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL4R\u00ce\u00b1 subunit with IL-2\u00ce\u00b3c (CD132). Type II IL-4 receptor is formed by the interaction of IL-4R\u00ce\u00b1 subunit with IL-13R\u00ce\u00b1. Interaction of IL-4 with its receptor results in receptor dimerization and activation. The Type I receptors activates JAK1 and 3, which are associated with the receptor subunits. The activated JAK phosphorylates tyrosine residues the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor which then serves as docking sites for a number of adaptor or signaling molecules including STAT6. Activated STAT6 dimerizes, translocated to the nucleus and transcriptionally actives genes responsive to IL-4. Many of the key functions of IL4 allergic disorders, including TH2 cell differentiation, airway hyper responsiveness, mucus cell metaplasia and IgE synthesis are dependent on STAT6 activation. Other phosphorylated tyrosine residue bind to proteins with phospho-tyrosine binding (PTB) motifs including IRS proteins. This results in the phosphorylation of the IRS proteins, which can then potentially activate the PI3K/AKT cascade by binding to the p85 subunit of PI3K or the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. The PI3K/AKT pathway is thought to mediate the growth and survival signals in multiple IL-4 responsive cell types including T- and B- lymphocytes and natural killer cells.\n\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_4_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

The kynurenine (Kyn)/Trp ratio is proposed to be an accurate indicator of biological age as well as an indicator of risk for age-related diseases (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020;  Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019). \n \nThe first and also rate-limiting enzymes that determine rate of Trp conversion into N-formylkynurenine and further on into Kyn are tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), out of which the IDO isoform IDO1 is the most important (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020;  Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Minhas et al., 2018; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019). This catalytic enzyme is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, interferons gamma and beta or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020; Dalton et al.,2020; Kondrikov et al., 2020; Li et al., 2017; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Oxenkrug, 2011; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Soegdrageret al., 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019). \n \nNext, N-formylkynurenine is converted either into kynurenic acid by a kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT), anthranilic acid by kynureninase or, into Kyn by formidase (AFMID) (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020). Kyn can alter the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation and induce oxidative stress through by inducing the transcription of multiple miRNAs (Dalton et al., 2020),  activating the p53/p21 pathway (Kondrikov et al., 2020) and  binding to AhR, resulting in a positive feedback loop, while further promoting oxidative stress (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, Dalton et al., 2020; 2020, Kondrikov et al., 2020). \n \nKyn is further converted into 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) by kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), then Kynureninase converts 3HK into 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA) and then into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde (ACMSA) (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020, Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019). 3-HK can alternatively be converted into xanthurenic acid, a metabolite that modulates the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway,(Tan & Guillemin, 2019). 3HAA can be converted either into quinolinic acid and from there enter the de novo NAD synthesis due to the enzymatic action of nicotinate-nucleotide pyrophosphorylase (QPRT), or it can be converted into 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde (AMSA) which can be converted into glutaryl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle and glycolysis (Castro-Portuguez & Sutphin, 2020; Lindquist et al., 2020; Lugo-Huitron et al., 2013; Platten et al., 2019; Savitz, 2019; Tan & Guillemin, 2019). \n\nKynurenine Pathway Library (https://enamine.net/hit-finding/focused-libraries/view-all/immuno-oncology-library/kynurenine-pathway-library) was also used as a reference for this pathway."

High aspect radio nanomaterials (i.e. long multiwalled carbon nanotubes) are thought to trigger \u201cfrustrated phagocytosis\u201d in macrophages, leading to NADPH oxidase (NOX1) activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and inflammasome activation. Smaller nanomaterials (i.e. short carbon nanotubes or silver nanoparticles of 28 nm), on the other hand, could be phagocytosed and once inside the cell induce lysosomal damage leading to release of cathepsins which cause mitochondrial damage and ROS production. In both cases, interaction of phagocytes with NAMPs induces an overproduction of ROS which results in assembly of NLRP3, ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and pro-caspase-1 into the multimeric inflammasome complex, resulting in activation of caspase-1, and release of mature IL-1\u03b2, a key pro-inflammatory mediator."

    "pathwayDescription": "Ceramides and insulin resistance are connectedd. Ceramides are accumulated in tissues due to an excess of saturated fatty acids. In obese subjects, the amount of ceramides found in skeletal muscles is nearly double that of healthy subjects. \n\nCeramides are produced mostly by the sphingolipid pathway. Besides the sphingolipid pathway, ceramides are also produced by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with the catalysis of nSMase2. \n\nIn the cell, ceramides play a role in insulin resistance. Ceramides inhibit the binding of PDX-1 and MAFA transcription factors to insulin promoter. Ceramides cause ER stress, which activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK8 and EIF2AK2. This leads to the upregulation of serine phosphorylation while downregulating tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. That, in turn, leads to the inhibition of recruitment and activation of PI3K. This leads to a downregulation in AKT1, an enzyme that stimulates the translocation of GLUT4. Ceramides also impair mitochondria functions and inhibit fatty acid oxidation, eventually leading to ROS and inflammation. Ceramides activate protein PP2A, which promotes the dephosphorylation of AKT1. PKC\u03b6 is also activated by ceramides to inhibit the activity of AKT1. \n\nMoreover, palmitoyl-CoA downregulates the phosphorylation of AMPK, which leads to the increase of ER stress in the cell and decreases in fatty acid oxidation. \n\nOn the other hand, oleic acid inhibits the downregulation of AMPK caused by palmitoyl-CoA. Oleic acid also increases the expression of CPT1B, stimulating the fatty acid oxidation to reduce the inflammation in the cell. \n"

Two smooth muscle-enriched, co-transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-143 and miR-145, cooperatively target this transcription factor network to promote smooth muscle cell differentiation. miR-145 also acts in a positive feed-foward regulatory loop to enhance expression of the smooth muscle regulator, Myocardin (Myocd), which cooperates with SRF to activate transcription of miR-143/145. Conversely, the cardiac and skeletal muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-133, which is also under transcriptional control of both SRF and Mef2C, acts in a negative feed-back loop to decrease SRF translation. Other miRNAs, including miR-214 and miR-199a, also target SRF, limiting its activity in specific cell types."

    "pathwayDescription": "Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is central to a number of physiological conditions, from embryogenesis to wound healing in adults and is a hallmark of pathological conditions such as tumorigenesis [1-3]. Angiogenesis is mediated by the coordinated action of a variety of growth factors, metabolites and cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells [4-6]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the principal angiogenic growth factor modulating neovascularization [7].\n\nThe biological effect of VEGF is mediated through specific VEGF receptors on endothelial cell surface. VEGFs (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C and VEGF-D) interact with VEGF receptors such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. Among them, VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling appears to mediate cellular responses involved in angiogenesis prominently. Further, VEGF/VEGFR1 signaling, though weak, converges to VEGFR2 signaling pathway. VEGFA binding to VEGFR2 at the surface of endothelial cells leads to dimerization and auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of VEGFR2. It leads to activation of multiple downstream signaling cascades and promotes endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation relevant to angiogenesis [8]. VEGFR2 dependent activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling regulates cell survival, cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic and cell permeability functions [9]. Another important pathway of VEGF mediated cell proliferation appears to be through PLC\u00ce\u00b3-mediated activation of PKC and downstream induction of the ERK and other PKC-dependent pathways [10]. Endothelial cell migration is induced by VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling through activation of p38MAPK (actin polymerization) and FAK (focal adhesion turnover) which is particularly important in directed migration. Phosphosite specificity towards downstream signalling has also been documented. Phosphosite mapping documented seven phosphosites in VEGFR2 receptor: Y1054, Y1214, Y801, Y1175, Y951, Y1059 and Y996. Phosphorylation of Y1214 and Y1054 regulates signaling events involved in cell migration. Y801 phosphorylation regulates cell survival. Y1175 regulates both cell proliferation and migration. Y951 and Y1059 phosphorylation regulates cell survival, cell migration and cell proliferation.\n\nVEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network compiles data available in the literature with respect to VEGFA signaling (especially VEGFA-165) through VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. The signaling events involving these proteins were derived from experimentally validated data involving multiple experimental techniques and approaches. Individual signaling events in VEGFR2 signaling networks leading to cell proliferation, migration and survival were identified and categorized into protein-protein interactions, enzyme-catalyzed events, activation/inhibition reactions, transport of protein across subcellular compartments, and gene regulation events. Signaling molecules involved in VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling were categorized to enzymes, receptors and transcription factors and the contextual activation/deactivation of these molecules downstream to VEGFA/ VEGFR2 signaling, in modulating angiogenesis, is documented.\n\nVEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map depicts the integration of signaling pathways regulating cell survival, cell migration, cell proliferation, cellular interactions downstream of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling relevant to angiogenesis, regulation of VEGFR2, phosphosite specificity of VEGFR2 towards downstream signaling, post-translational modifications, molecular function-based information, cross-talks among proteins in the canonical signaling modules and the information on the compartmentalization of proteins. The map of VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling network is interactive to help investigators to add new information as it becomes available in the future for analysis or representation.\n\n\nVEGFA dependent angiogenesis pathway map may please be cited as:\n \n1.

First the terminal cysteine is farnesylated by farnesyl transferase, where a isoprenyl group is added to the cysteine residue -also called isoprenylation. This is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the aaX part by Zmpste24 and methylation (CH3) of cysteine. Isoprenylation and methylation are both necessary for the localization of lamin A and B-type lamins in to the INM. Until this point processing of lamin A and type-B lamins is similar. While in type-B lamins the isoprenyl group remains attached to the cysteine, lamin A has a second cleavage site to cleave off an additional 15 amino acids upstream of the cysteine. This cleavage is also done by Zmpste24 and takes place at INM. When these 15 amino acids, 18 in total including aaX, are cleaved off mature lamin A is produced (1,2).

Leukotrienes are a group of biologically active lipid mediators who are derived pre-dominantly from arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxygenase pathways. This pathway follow two routes, one include cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4), the second starting at LTB4. \n\nThis pathway is linked to five disorders, out of which three are caused by hereditary primary defects in one enzyme also know as Inherited Metabolic Disorders or IMDs/IEMs (disorders depicted in pink). The clinical presentation of LTC4 synthase deficiency includes muscular hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly and failure to thrive. The other two defects, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency (GGT1 protein, also know as Glutathionuria) and membrane-bound dipeptidase deficiency (DPEP1 protein, responsible for a wide range of dipeptides hydrolytic reactions), have been studied to a lesser degree. Two additional disorders can be linked to this pathway: an increased risk of ischemic stroke is linked to the 5-LOAP protein (PMID:15640973 and 14770184) and deafness (ABCC1 autosomical dominant disorder, found in one family, severe hearing loss as adult, the relationship between the phenotype and gene is provisional).\n\nThis pathway was inspired by Chapter 38 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)).\n"

    "pathwayDescription": "Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells convert glucose to lactate as their main source for energy production, instead of using the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. This process is called the Warburg effect. This pathway shows the effects deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and their substrates have. DUBs free proteins of their ubiquitin chain, so that the proteins can resume their function in the cells rather than be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). \nThe deubiquitination of VHL via OTUD6B (part of a DUB subfamily) represses HIF-1\u03b1, whereas the direct deubiquitination of HIF-1a via DUBs leads to the increased expression of GLUT1 and VEGF. The transcription factor c-Myc helps regulate gene expression involved in the glucose metabolism (e.g., GLUT1, HK2, LDHA) and is stabilised by ubiquitin-specific proteases.  The PI3K/Akt pathway is also upregulated by deubiquitination of VEGF and Akt. This entails cell growth and apoptosis regulation, as well as promoted glucose transport to cancer cells and activating mTor, which improves glycolysis.\nIt is shown in this pathway, how deubiquitinating enzymes play an important role in stabilizing different proteins, acting as oncoproteins and tumor suppressors equally.\nThis pathway is based on figure 3 featured in \u201cRegulation of Cancer Metabolism by Deubiquitinating Enzymes: The Warburg Effect\u201d by So-Hee Kim and Kwang-Hyun Baek."

After 7 weeks there is a differentiation between XY and XX gonads.\n\nIn the XX gonad, the absence of the gene SRY will result in the under expression of the SOX9 gene. This will have as a consequence that the SOX9 gene will not reach its threshold. Along with the expression of RSPO1 and WNT4, \u03b2-catenin is signalled and will lead to further inhibition of SOX9 and stimulation of FST and FOXL2. Both RSPO1 and WNT, as well as the combination of FST and FOXL2 are stimulated by NR5A1. This process will lead to the formation of the ovary due to the suppression of the formation of the testis, by inhibition of the genes. Due to the absence of androgens the female reproductive system can develop.\n\nIn the XY gonad the gene SRY is expressed in the pre-Sertoli cells leading to an upregulation of the SOX9 gene. In this upregulation NR5A1 has a promoting function to increase the SOX9 levels until it reaches its threshold level. once this level is reached a regulatory loop of FGF9 and PGD2 is activated to keep constant levels of SOX9. Another promoting factor of SOX9 is PGDS, this factor also stimulates the expression of SOX9. After the threshold levels are reached AMH is stimulated by SOX9. This stimulation is being catalysed by NR5A1, GATA4, WT1 and SOX8. AMH can then further stimulate AMHR2 and promote the regression of the M\u00fcllerian Ducts. AMH is possibly also involved in the suppression of genes involved in the formation of female structures, such as FOXL2 by DMRT1. When the Sertoli Cell is fully formed, it can induce the development of foetal Leydig cells via the DHH-pathway which produced INSL3. INSL3 is promoted by testosterone. Testosterone in itself is stimulated by NR5A1 and also stimulates the formation of 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The stimulation of DHT is catalysed by SRD5A1. These factors together induce the formation of internal and external male genitalia. "

This isotype of CYP450 was found to be involved in the formation of carcinogenic metabolites. Both of these effects culminate in DNA damage.  It has been observed, however, that these pro-oxidant effects are dominant at higher concentrations, whereas anti-oxidant effects are dominant at lower concentrations.

Consequently, the levels of proinflammatory Ang II rise, while the levels of anti-inflammatory Ang-(1-7) decrease.

Through expression of cytokines such as TNF, TGF-beta and interferons, IL-1 holds a range of inflammatory activities that include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules and roles in arthritis and septic shock. IL-1 binds to the respective IL-1 receptor however, it requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP) to transduce a signal. Two kinases (IRAK-1 and IRAK-2) get activated through IL-1 binding to its receptor. Via these kinases a cascade gets activated which includes TRAF6, NF-kB activation and c-JUN activation.

    "pathwayDescription": "The intratumoral production of estradiol-17beta (E2) from circulating steroid hormone precursors plays an essential role in estrogen-related breast and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). There are two possible pathways producing E2, one being the sulfatase pathway starting from estrone sulfate, and one being the aromatase pathway which starts with DHEA-S. Both routes rely on two crucial enzymes: STS for estrogen activation and SULT1E1 for inactivation. Research indicates that an increased STS expression and E2 production is associated with cancer progression. However, sulfonation of E2 via SULT1E1 not only reduces proliferative effects of estrogens on hormone-sensitive tumor cells, but also generates water-soluble estrogen sulfates consequently leading to an increased excretion of sulfonated E2. This helps preventing a metabolic activation of the hormone into potentially mutagenic catechol metabolites. Thus, targeting estrogen-modifying enzymes is a potential endocrine therapy strategy for patients with estrogen-sensitive EOC.\n\nThis pathway is based on Figure 1 from: Mungenast, F., Aust, S., Vergote, I., Vanderstichele, A., Sehouli, J., Braicu, E., Mahner, S., Castillo\u2011Tong, D.

    "pathwayDescription": "The induction of Type I interferons and signaling is the first response leading to the innate immune reactions during SARS-COV-2 infection. The virus can enter host cells through two mechanisms. If it enters the cell via diffusion mediated by TMPRSS2, the virus ssRNA will be detected by RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytosol. If the virus enters the cell via endocytosis, the spike proteins will be processed by CTSL in the lysosome leading to the detection of ssRNA by TLR3,7 and 9 (PMID 33506952). The extracellular virus can also be detected by TLR2,4 and 6 (PMID 33506952). The higher production of TLR4 in men and the presence of TLR7 on the X chromosome may contribute to the different responses between women and men during SARS-CoV 2 infection (PMID 33506952). \n\nTLR7 MYD88-dependent signaling is inhibited at multiple steps by the SARS-CoV Papain-Like Protease (PLpro) domain of nsp3 (red oval). The signaling pathway is critical to induction of type I interferons (INF-I) via IRF3, AP-1 and NFkB transcription factors. INF-I triggers the JAK/STAT pathway leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as OAS and PKR, which go one to conduct the innate immune response. TREML4 has been shown to be necessary for MYD88 recruitment by TLR7 and STAT1 participation. The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro by GRL0617 is proposed based on Ratia, et al. 2008 and 100% sequence identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 across all 13 residues of PLpro involved in binding GRL0617 (82.9% identity across 316 amino acids) as determined by the alignment of RefSeq YP_009725299.1 and PDB 3E9S (https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/#Nsp3_PLpro_domain). The antimicrobial agent, azithromycin, is in clincal trials as COVID-19 therapy in combination with hydroxychloroquine (Gautret 2020) has been shown to modulate inflammation by inhibiting the activation of many of these same transcription factors."

Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by a phospholipase A2 (PLA-2) enzyme and converted to bioactive PGE-2 by COX-2. PGE2 induces transactivation of the EGFR by triggering Src and PGE2, an important regulator of CYP19A1 gene expression, stimulates CYP19A1 activity to increase localized estrogen 17-beta-estradiol (E2). The E2 binds to the classical ER to promote its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where it modulates the expression of estrogen target genes (COX-2). The interaction of E2 with ER-alpha also activates signaling cascades that promote cell proliferation, such as the activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase (Src). Src activation stimulates a matrix metalloproteinase cascade that culminates in liberating the EGF. The free EGF ligand binds to EGFR family receptors that activate ERK signaling cascade. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA) is a substrate for ERK and phosphorylation of cPLA (cPLAp), promoting its association with intracellular membranes such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria releasing lysophospholipids and arachidonic acid from these membranes. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into PGE-2. \n\nThese key molecules and pathways that connect chronic inflammation with inflammation-associated oncogenic transformation could be targeted by drugs or natural products for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for malignant mesothelioma."

It becomes active during pregnancy and lactation, when there is a formation of alveoli, the structure responsible for milk production. \nThere are four signal inputs for the mammary gland development during pregnancy and lactation: (1) prolactin receptor (PRLR), (2) epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR aka ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3 and ERBB4), (3) estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and (4) progesterone receptor (PGR).\nIn the first case, PRL binds to PRLR, allowing its phosphorylation by JAK2, and the consequent coupling of STAT5 [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422). JAK2 phosphorylates STAT5, allowing its migration to nucleus. STAT5 target genes are related to proliferation (TNFSF11, CCND1), differentiation (CSN2, WFDC, ELF5, GJB2) and survival (BCL2L1) [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422). CEBPA and CEBPB are related to the balance between proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9513715). The TNFSF11/ TNFRSF11A pathway is associated with proliferation [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422). MYC, galanin and PTPN1 are regulators of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway and UFS are implicated in cell cycle control [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422) [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15689376) [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12907752) [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23154416).\nIn the second case, NRG binds to one of its receptors (ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3 or ERBB4) and the signal is transmitted  by ERBB4  to  STAT5, from where it follows as described above [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422). ERBB4 substitutes JAK2 by phosphorylating STAT5.\nFinally, in the last two cases, estrogen binds to its receptors, ESR1 and ESR2, and stimulates PGR [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231422). ESR1, ESR2 and PGR are associated with proliferation. ESR1 also affects adhesion through induction of TTC9, which interacts with TPM3 (a protein associated with actin filaments), playing a role in involution [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22917536).\nPNCK appears to negatively regulate EGFR and MAPK signaling during pregnancy [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18562482). ATP2C2 is co-expressed with the component of calcium influx channel encoded by ORAI1.  Together, they regulate Ca2+ uptake, influencing differentiation and supporting the large calcium transport requirements for milk secretion during lactation [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23840669)."

The cytoplasmic and nuclear NAD+ pools probably equilibrate by diffusion through the nuclear pore. However, the mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to both NAD+ and NADH. Reducing equivalents generated by glycolysis are transferred to the mitochondrial matrix via the malate/aspartate shuttle and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate shuttle. The resulting mitochondrial NADH (malate/aspartate shuttle) is oxidized by complex I in the electron transport chain, whereas the resulting FADH2 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate shuttle) is oxidized by complex II. In each of the three compartments, different NAD+-consuming enzymes lead to the generation of nicotinamide, which is recycled via the NAD+ salvage pathway. Different forms of the NMNAT enzyme and sirtuins are localized in different compartments. The nature of the salvage pathway for NAD+ in mitochondria has not been fully resolved, although NMNAT3 has been found in mitochondria.\n\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3644)."

There are three known G-protein coupled receptor subtypes of galanin: GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3. Galaninergic signaling is predominantly inhibitory which mainly involves MAPK, AKT, and AC pathways. Galanin peptides have a wide range of non-neuronal functions as well as classic neuromodulatory roles, so they are often considered regulatory peptides. Galanin in general is associated with several biological functions such as arousal and sleep regulation, nociception, learning, inflammation, feeding, and neuroendocrine regulation. It is also implicated in diseases like Alzheimer's, depression, epilepsy, mood disorders, stress, anxiety, diabetes mellitus, and chronic pain.\n\nThe creation of this pathway is described in [Gopalakrishnan et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136286/)."

    "pathwayTitle": "TNF-alpha signaling",
    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP231",
    "pathwayDescription": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in various biological processes including regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and immune response. TNF\u03b1 is mainly produced by macrophages, also by other tissues including lymphoid cells, mast cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and neuronal tissues. TNF was identified as a soluble cytokine produced upon the activation by the immune system and able to exert cytotoxicity on tumor cell lines and cause tumor necrosis in animal models. TNF is primarily produced as a type II transmembrane protein arranged as stable homotrimers. The members of TNF\u03b1 family exert their cellular effect through two distinct surface receptors of the TNF receptor family, TNFRSF1A (TNF-R1) and TNFRSF1B (TNF-R2). TNF-R1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas TNF-R2 is found typically on cells of the immune system and is highly regulated. TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 binds membrane-integrated TNF (memTNF) as well as soluble TNF (sTNF) TNF-R1 contains a protein-protein interaction domain, called death domain (DD). This domain interacts with other DD-containing proteins and couples the death receptors to caspase activation and apoptosis. TNF-R2 induces gene expression by a TRAF-2 dependent signaling mechanism and also crosstalk's with TNF-R1. The pleiotropic biological effects of TNF can be attributed to its ability to simultaneously activate multiple signaling pathways in cells. Binding of TNF\u03b1 to TNF-R1 on the cell surface triggers trimerization of the receptor and exposes intracellular domain of TNF-R1 following the release of an inhibitory protein. This intracellular domain recruits a death-domain containing adaptor protein, TRADD by homophilic interactions. TRADD, which acts as a scaffold protein, recruits TRAF2 and RIPK1 to form a complex , referred to as complex 1.  Complex 1 is believed to be important in NF-\u03baB activation and JNK activation. Complex 1 eventually dissociates from the receptor and integrates FADD and procaspase8 to form a complex referred to as the complex 2. In some cases, FADD/CASP8 association depends on high molecular weight complexes containing unubiquitinated RIPK1 as scaffold. Activated CASP8 induces CASP3 activity and execution of apoptosis. CASP8 activates apoptotic signal through another mechanism involving BID cleavage to truncated BID (tBID). tBID translocates to the mitochondria, increasing its outer membrane permeability. This results in cytochrome C release and activation of other caspases ultimately leading to apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been found to increase during or after complex 1 and 2 formation to mediate or potentiate apoptosis upon TNF stimulation. TRAF-2 in complex 1 also activates the MAP kinase cascade, that leads to the activation of JNK, which on prolonged activation is believed to mediate both apoptosis and necrotic cell death.  On complex 1 formation, NF-\u03baB regulated anti-apoptotic gene products efficiently block initiation of apoptosis by complex 2. There is evidence of an early attempt to signal for apoptosis, which precedes the activation of NF-\u03baB. The intracellular part of TNF-R1 binds to NSMAF which in turn mediates SMPD2-dependant ceramide production from cell membrane. Ceramide induces membrane permeabilization and apoptosis. This is observed before TNF-R1 internalization and NF-\u03baB activation. This process is repressed on TNF-R1 internalization. This signal however is enough to initiate apoptosis in some cells. Another form of cell death, necrosis, is also mediated through TNF stimulation. On TNF stimulation, deubiquitinated RIPK1 dissociates from complex 1 and recruits RIPK3, FADD and CASP8. RIPK3 is autophosphorylated and phosphorylates RIPK1. Taken together, it has been speculated that RIP1 and RIP3 increase carbohydrate and glutamine metabolism of the cell, leading to increased ROS production and eventual necrosis. Recruitment of CASP8, activation of FADD/RIP1 and apoptosis induction, is blunted when RIPK1 becomes ubiquitinated. IKBKG binds to ubiquitinated RIPK1 to induce the activation of NF-\u03baB, which exerts antiapoptotic effects. Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, BIRC2 and BIRC3 has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity and functionally interact with TRAF2 and RIPK1  to induce polyubiquitination of RIPK1 upon TNF stimulation. Loss of these inhibitors attenuates TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation. The adaptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3 bind preferentially to Lys-63 polyubiquitinated RIPK1. This facilitates dimerization of MAP3K7, promoting its phosphorylation and activation. The IKK complex, consisting of CHUK, IKBKB and IKBKG, is recruited to RIP1 through binding of IKBKG to the ubiquitin chain of RIP1. Activated TAK1 directly phosphorylates IKBKB within the activation loop, leading to activation of the IKK complex and NF-\u03baB. Certain regulatory proteins have been known to intercept NF-\u03baB activation at the level of ubiquitinated RIP1. TNFAIP3, an NF-\u03baB inhibitory protein, removes Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain and promotes Lys-48 linked ubiquitination of RIPK1 leading to its degradation and NF-\u03baB signal termination. IKBKG stabilizes the bound polyubiquitinated RIPK1 by inhibiting its degradation, most probably by impairing its interaction with TNFAIP3. OTUD7B is recruited to the activated TNF-R1 and promotes RIP1 deubiquitination, thereby attenuating NF-\u03baB activation. At internalized TNF-receptosomes, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by endocytic vesicle associated RFFL, inducing RIPK1 degradation, which terminates NF-\u03baB activation. When successful, TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation induces transcription and expression of genes encoding proinflammatory IL-6, anti-apoptotic factors BIRC2, BIRC3 and BCL-2 homologue BCL2L1. This causes the cell to remain inert to apoptotic stimuli.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tnf_alpha_pathway.html) database.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP231)."

    "pathwayDescription": "The mammary gland development can be subdivided into four stages of development: (1) embryonic development, (2) puberty, (3) pregnancy and lactation and (4) involution. In the embryonic development, a pair of mammary lines (ectoderm) arises, which gives origin to a pair of placodes. Then, each placode penetrates the underlying mesoderm. This results in the formation of the primary mammary gland [Smalley et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14668814).\nNRG3 is a signal for placode formation. Besides that, it influences cell fate: it binds to its receptor, ERBB4, and induces MYC, which decreases expression of the integrins ITGA6 and ITGB1. The result is a change in cell adhesion and proliferation and consequent exit from the stem cell compartment [Panchal et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17880691).\nAnother process that should be highlighted in the embryonic development is the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). ZEB2 is an EMT regulator. It represses many genes (eg. CCND1, SFRP1, MIR200A, MIR200B, MIR429, TERT, CDH1, CLDN4 and ALPL), and also upregulates mesenchymal markers [Katoh et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592). CCND1 and SFRP1 are related to cell proliferation, and SFRP1 are also related to WNT signaling pathway. MIR200A, MIR200B and MIR429 are microRNAs. TERT is responsible for elongation of telomere ends. CDH1 and CLDN4 are associated with cell adhesion, and ALPL may play a role in skeletal mineralization. Many genes modulate ZEB2. Some of these are shown in the figure [Katoh et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592). TGFB1, TNF and IL1 are cytokines and AKT1 plays a role in many processes like cell proliferation, survival and growth. Hedgehog signals upregulate ZEB2 via TGFB1 [Katoh et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19424592)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Nuclear receptors are transcription factors that are activated upon binding to its ligands. Initially, they had been classified as classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors and orphan receptors. However, further studies have led to the identification of lipid ligands for some of these adopted orphan receptors, which are responsible for lipid metabolism, storage or elimination. One of the characteristics of these receptors is that they act by forming heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). The receptors include peroxisome proliferators-Activated receptors (PPARs) for fatty acids, liver X receptor (LCR) for oxysterols, Farnesoid X receptors (FXR) for bile acids and steroid xenobiotic receptor/X receptor (SXR/PXR or Nsil2) for xenobiotics. Other orphan receptors also require RXR for its functions are vitamin D receptor (VDR) for vitamin D and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) for retinoid acids, although these receptors are not involved in lipid metabolism. Upon binding to various ligands, three classes of proteins are synthesized including lipid binding proteins, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and cytochrome P450 member proteins which catalyzes lipid anabolism, metabolism and elimination.\nIn addition to lipid metabolism, some members of the cytochrome P450 family genes are responsible for activation of procarcinogens, detoxification of environmental toxins and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. In particular, CAR, Nsil2 and recently identified VDR are important in up-regulation of these cytochromes. Of all the human cytochrome P450 genes, only a few CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 account for most toxicity effects, specifically CYP3A is responsible for clearing approximately half of the clinically prescribed drugs. For instance, acetaminophen, one of the most commonly used drug, is toxic in high doses due to the activation of CAR and the drugs subsequent conversion to acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A. \n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP299)"

    "pathwayDescription": "NAD+ biosynthetic pathways. NAD+ levels are maintained by three independent pathways. First, the Preiss-Handler pathway uses dietary nicotinic acid and the enzyme nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT) to generate NAMN, which is then transformed into NAAD by NAMN transferase (NMNAT). Three forms of this enzyme (NMNAT1, -2, and -3) have distinct subcellular localizations. The process is completed by the transformation of NAAD into NAD+ by NAD+ synthase (NADS). Second, the de novo synthesis pathway of NAD from tryptophan occurs through the kinurenine pathway (5). The first step in this pathway is the rate-limiting conversion of tryptophan to N-formylkinurenine (N-formylkin) by either IDO or TDO. Formylkinurenine is transformed into L-kinurenine (L-kin), 3-hydroxykinurenine, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) and finally to ACMS. This compound can spontaneously condense and rearrange into quinolinic acid, which is transformed into NAMN, at which point it converges with the Preiss-Handler pathway. ACMS can also be decarboxylated into AMS by ACMS decarboxylase (ACMSD), leading to its oxidation into acetyl-CoA via the TCA cycle. Third, the NAD+ salvage pathway recycles the nicotinamide generated as a by-product of the enzymatic activities of NAD+-consuming enzymes: sirtuins, PARPs, and the cADPR synthases (CD38 and CD157). Initially, NAMPT recycles nicotinamide into NMN, which is then converted into NAD+ via the different NMNATs.\n\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3645)."

In intramembranous ossification (osteogenesis in the scull and clavicles), preosteoblasts stem directly from mesenchymal stem cells, while in endochondral (osteogenesis of the axial skeleton and the limbs) a common osteo-chondro progenitor gives rise to both cell types.\n\nExtracellular signals regulating osteoblast differentiation: Model is based on studies of the mouse limb skeleton. Osteoblasts differentiate from mesenchymal progenitors (MP) through distinct developmental stages marked by expression of key transcription factors including SOX9, RUNX2, and OSX. Mature osteoblasts (OB) can further differentiate to osteocytes (OCY) or bone lining cells (not depicted) or undergo apoptosis (not depicted).\n\nIndian hedgehog (IHH) signaling is required for osteoblast differentiation during endochondral bone development. IHH binding to the receptor Patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) activates signaling through Smoothened (SMO), thereby inhibiting the generation of the proteolytically cleaved GLI3 repressor (GLI3R) and promoting the generation of the full-length GLI2 activator (GLI2A). Whereas derepression of GLI3R is sufficient to generate RUNX2+ cells, both derepression of GLI3R and activation of GLI2A are necessary for progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage. NOTCH signaling inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Following binding to their ligands, Jagged (JAG) or Delta-like (DLL), Notch receptors are proteolytically cleaved by the g-secretase complex, leading to release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. NICD interacts with RBPJk and together they activate downstream target genes, including HES (Hairy and Enhancer of Split) and HEY (HES-related with YRPW motif) family transcription factors, ultimately leading to inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, seemingly at a stage before OSX activation.\n\nWNT signaling promotes osteoblast differentiation. During b-catenin-dependent WNT signaling, b-catenin is stabilized following binding of WNT to its receptors Frizzled (FZD) and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6, leading to the transcription of b-catenin target genes and ultimately stimulating progression from the RUNX2+ stage to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage, and from RUNX2+OSX+ cells to mature osteoblasts. WNTcan also signal independently of LRP5/6 and b-catenin through protein kinase Cd (PKCd), promoting progression to the RUNX2+OSX+ stage through an unknown mechanism.\n\nBone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling stimulates osteoblast differentiation and function. Binding of BMP2 or BMP4 to their receptors results in phosphorylation of SMAD1, SMAD5, or SMAD8. These can then form a complex with their partner, SMAD4, and enter the nucleus to regulate gene expression, ultimately promoting the transition to RUNX2+OSX+ cells and enhancing the function of mature osteoblasts; however, a direct role for SMAD signaling in osteoblast differentiation remains to be shown.\n\nFibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has diverse roles in osteoblast lineage cells. FGFs function by binding to cell surface Tyr kinase FGF receptors (FGFR1\u2013FGFR4 in humans and mice), leading to the activation of multiple signaling modules. FGF signaling regulates preosteoblast proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, as well as the function of mature osteoblasts. However, the precise stages at which FGFs regulate proliferation and differentiation, and the intracellular signaling cascades responsible for each function, remain to be elucidated.

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP706",
    "pathwayDescription": "In this model, we provide an integrated view of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) at the level of implicated tissues, signaling networks and genetics. The purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and recommend new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden and unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during deep sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate SIDS are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position, environment and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm). While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population. The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301, PMID: 20124538). One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has been the raphe nucleus of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural, cellular and molecular changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987, PMID: 20124538). This region of the brain is responsible for the large majority of neuronal serotonin produced and is functionally important in the regulation of normal cardiopulmonary activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).\n\nGenes associated with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic association with SIDS. Principle among these genes the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme TPH2, the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4 exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus of the medulla oblongata and polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987). In 75% of infants with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls along with an increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987). Over-expression of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse medulla produces an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and hypothermia (PMID:18599790). These genes as well as those involved in serotonin synthesis are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV (human orthologue of PET-1). PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin neurons (PMID:12546819), while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African American infants with SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated in the regulation of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and FEV are also listed (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin signaling and its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway of cardiopulmonary regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin signaling, named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results in a SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal death, exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in mice. Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A are both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however, it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons. \n\nAnother potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).\n\nIn addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively common one (SP1).\n\nFinally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4, many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS. In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1 are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064). Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among the most significant risk factors for SIDS. \n\nIn loving memory of Milo Salomonis (http://www.milosalomonis.org). \n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP706).\n"

In this process, vitamin K1 (taken up from the diet) is converted to vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2), either by the dithiol-dependent vitamin K-epoxide reductase (VKOR) or by NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1. KH2 is in turn oxidized to vitamin K epoxide (KO) by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX). During this conversion, GGCX activates the VKDPs by converting glutamate (Glu) to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Lastly, KO is converted back into vitamin K quinone by VKOR. \n\nWarfarin, a drug commonly used as a anticoagulant, inhibits VKOR, thus reducing the levels of VKH2 in the bloodstream.\nA too high dosage of warfarin can lead to heavy bleeding, a life-threatening condition.\nThreatment of this condition is a high dosis of Vitamine K, which is reduced to VHK2 by FSP1, a warfarin resistant reductase.\nThe influence of FSP1 on this process, as well as its potential to eliminate lipid perozyl radicals, has been recently described in [Nature (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05022-3) by Mishima et al.: A non-canonical vitamin K cycle is a potent ferroptosis suppressor. \n\n"

TGF\u03b2 superfamily ligands bind to a type II receptor, which recruits and phosphorylates a type I receptor.

Various kinases (ERK, JNK, IKKbeta, PKCzeta, PKCtheta and mTOR) are involved in this process.\n\nThe development of type II diabetes requires impaired beta-cell function. Chronic hyperglycemia has been shown to induce multiple defects in beta-cells. Hyperglycemia has been proposed to lead to large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in beta-cells, with subsequent damage to cellular components including PDX-1. Loss of PDX-1, a critical regulator of insulin promoter activity, has also been proposed as an important mechanism leading to beta-cell dysfunction.\n\n Although there is little doubt as to the importance of genetic factors in type II diabetes, genetic analysis is difficult due to complex interaction among multiple susceptibility genes and between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have therefore given very diverse results. Kir6.2 and IRS are two of the candidate genes.

    "pathwayDescription": "This pathway includes the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cells (NRK52E cell) with a basolateral and apical side and other schematic illustrated organelles involved in the process of kidney function. The influence of regucalcin on the intra-and extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a regulation is showed which are both involved in cell proliferation, ion transport and apoptosis and are important in normal kidney function. When the regulation of regucalcin and other factors are downregulated and suppressed, the kidney fails in functionality and so renal fibrosis will develop.  \nFirst of all, TGF-B (TGFB1) and TNF-a (TNFA) do have an impact on the activity of SMAD2/4 which has an impact on the development of a-SMA (ACTA2) that induced renal fibrosis. NF-kB (TNFSF11), stimulated by TNF-a, activates the transcription factor p65 (RELA) that induced the IL-8 expression which is involved in inflammatory pathways. On the other hand, regucalcin inhibits the a-SMA which means that the formation of renal fibrosis is inhibited. Further, TGF-B stimulates the caspase 8 (CASP8) that activates the cytochrome C which activate the apoptosis pathway. Also, here regucalcin function as an inhibitor for APAF1 that results in an inhibition of the apoptosis pathway and activate the BCL-2 (suppressor of apoptotic cell death). \nBesides the TGF-B and TNF-a pathway, there is an RTK pathway illustrated which activates the PI3K (PI3K3CA) and RAS (G3BP1) pathway for stimulation of the renal homeostasis, autophagy, protein and cell proliferation. According to Yamaguchi M. (2015), regucalcin activates the AKT1 to induce the renal homeostasis, autophagy and protein proliferation even further when PI3K is inhibited. The RTK pathway shows interaction with the cAMP pathway that stimulate the protein kinase A (PRKACA) and the PIP2 pathway that stimulate the protein kinase C (PRKCQ) and IP3. These all will stimulate Ca\u00b2\u207a release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  This Ca\u00b2\u207a can migrate and enters the mitochondria through the Ca\u00b2\u207a uniporter (MCU) which results in the activation of mitochondrial biological processes or release of different mitochondrial factors. Hence, calcium controls and modulate cell apoptosis and inflammation. MAP3K pathway might be involved in the stimulation of RAF1 to induce the cell proliferation and the increase in apoptosis by inhibition of BCL-2 through JNK (MAPK10) which is also activated by ROS. \n\nCa\u00b2\u207a released by the ER can also bind to calmodulin to form the Ca\u00b2\u207a/Calmodulin complex that stimulates IP3, JNK, NOS, RGPR\u2014p117 (SEC16B) and NF1. The latter two proteins are involved in the enhancement of regucalcin gene expression. On the other hand, regucalcin can inhibit the activity of Ca\u00b2\u207a/Calmodulin complex and the NOS. Normally, phosphodiesterase (PDE1B) binds cAMP that induced the degradation of cAMP which results in a decrease of protein kinase A that leads to a reduction of ER Ca\u00b2\u207a release. Regucalcin inhibits the phosphodiesterase in such a way that cAMP will not be degraded and the ER Ca\u00b2\u207a release can further occur. Remaining Ca\u00b2\u207a released from the ER can also transport to the microsomes, enters vis Ca\u00b2\u207a uniporter, to induce microsomal activities. This process of microsomal Ca\u00b2\u207a uptake can be diminished through the inhibition of IP3 kinase. \nRegucalcin is not only involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a release or uptake, but also extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a by stimulating the Ca\u00b2\u207a/ATPase (ATP2B3) which leads to Ca\u00b2\u207a export. Besides that, the Na+/Ca\u00b2\u207a exchanger (SLC8A1) is important to be present on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule epithelial kidney cell to regulate the ion transport. On the apical membrane is the TRPV5 receptor present that regulate the import of Ca\u00b2\u207a from the lumen back into the kidney cell, but Ca\u00b2\u207a can also travel via paracellular transport. \nFurther, in the nucleus the regucalcin has an influence on the inhibition of the serine/threonine phosphate (PSP), tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and calcineurin (PPP3R1) gene expression. Normally, PSP stimulates the protein kinase A- and so the ER Ca\u00b2\u207a release-, PTP stimulates the cell growth and differentiation and calcineurin will migrate to the cytoplasm for binding to the Ca\u00b2\u207a and stimulates the formation of Ca\u00b2\u207a/Calmodulin complex. \nIn general, regucalcin regulates the factors and proteins involved in ion transport, cell proliferation and apoptosis. \nResearch is done on rats. \n"

This gene is located on chromosome 20p13 and is composed of two exons. Mutations in the PRNP gene cause conformational changes in the prion protein (PRNP). The normal PRNP (protein) changes into the pathologic PRNP. A molecular pathway can give a better understanding in prion diseases.\n\n\nThis pathway is a prion disease pathway, that describes what happens when there is a mutation in the PRNP gene. The left part of the pathway represents the pathway retrieved from literature and the right part of the pathway represents data found using databases. The left part shos the interaction of pathological prion protein with an unknown receptor protein, this interaction activates a signalling pathway. The endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium and ER stress is induced. Activation of Caspase 12 by ER-stress is followed by cleavage and activation of the executioner Caspase-3, causing neuronal apoptosis. According to the databases, NCAM-1 can initiate two mechanisms: the activation of FGFR and formation of intracellular signalling complexes. NCAM-1 interacts with Fyn and FAK, resulting in phosphorylation of these two tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of Fyn and FAK results in activation of MAPK, ERK1 and 2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and transcription factors ELK and NFkB. CREB activates transcription of genes which are important for axonal growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity in neurons.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3995)."

When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.\n\nIn chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, nicotine binds to the ganglion-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is composed of alpha 3 (CHRNA3) and beta 4 (CHRNB4) subunits. By binding to the receptors, nicotine causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage dependent calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from the chromaffin vesicles into the bloodstream, which leads to increased heart rate and blood pressure and elevation of blood glucose level.\n\nSources: [PharmGKB Nicotine in Chromaffin Cells](http://www.pharmgkb.org), [Wikipedia:Nicotine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine)"

    "pathwayDescription": "Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process during which cells lose their epithelial characteristics, and gain mesenchymal properties, such as increased motility. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EMT is associated with an invasive or metastatic phenotype. During EMT, tumor cells undergo tight junction dissolution, disruption of apical\u2013basal polarity, and reorganization of the cytoskeletal architecture, which enable cells to develop an invasive phenotype. In cancer cells, EMT is abnormally regulated by extracellular stimuli derived from the tumor microenvironment, including growth factors and inflammatory cytokines, along with intra-tumoral physical stresses such as hypoxia. Therefore, EMT programming allows tumor cells to adapt to the constant changes of the human tumor microenvironment, and thus to successfully metastasize. This pathway summarizes the major signaling pathways and inducers that promote EMT in CRC. \nA set of core transcription factors regulate EMT: SNAIL family of zinc-finger transcription factors SNAIL/SLUG; the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB) family of transcription factors ZEB1/ZEB2, and the TWIST family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors TWIST1/TWIST2. \n(Adapted from Vu et al.)

It was discovered by Carl Ferdinand Cori and Gerty Cori.\n\nMuscular activity requires ATP, which is provided by the breakdown of glycogen in the skeletal muscles. \nDuring glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen produces glucose in the form of glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P), which is then converted to G-6-P by phosphoglucomutase. \nG-6-P is fed into glycolysis, a process that provides ATP to the muscle cells as an energy source. It can also go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration is high.\n\nDuring muscular activity, ATP stores need to be constantly replenished. When the oxygen supply is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding pyruvate (from glycolysis), to the Krebs cycle. \n\nWhen the oxygen supply is insufficient, for example during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through anaerobic metabolism. \nDuring lactic acid fermentation, lactate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to lactate. Fermentation regenerates NAD+, maintaining the NAD+ concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes the NADH produced by glycolysis back to NAD+, transferring two electrons from NADH to reduce pyruvate into lactate. Lactacte produced by anaerobic fermentation does not accumulate inside the muscle cells, instead it is taken up by the liver, which initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is supplied to the muscles through the bloodstream and is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through glycogenesis.\n\nThe glycolysis part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. Therefor, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The Cori cycle shifts the metabolic burden from the muscles to the liver.\n\nSource: Adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_cycle).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1946)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Sphingolipids, which include sphingomyelins, sphingosines and ceramides are bioactive bioactive molecules present in all eukaryotic cells, are important in regulating various aspects of cell biology, such as cell cycle, proliferation, and even senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018). Evidence shows that ceramide metabolism is deregulated in cellular senescence and can even induce it. (Venable et al., 2006).\n\nCeramides are thought to induce senescence in a p53 dependent and independent manner by hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Lee et al., 2000; Dix 2018; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Ceramides function both down- and upstream of p53 (Jeffries et al., 2018). p53 mediates the interference of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma-like protein RBL1 and RBL through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (Jeffries et & Krupenko, 2018). Additionally, p53 has been demonstrated to directly activate ceramide synthase. (Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Consequently, this implies a feedback mechanism between ceramides and the tumor suppressor.  Ceramide also interacts directly with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) by inhibiting it, therefore causing telomere instability (Hannun & Obeid, 2002; Deevska et al., 2021). \n\nCeramides activate protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), which increases the levels of p21 (Trayssac et al., 2018). This then inhibits the cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and CDK4. As a consequence, the retinoblastoma protein is hypophosphorylated and induces senescence (Lee et al., 2000; Dix 2018). The hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein leads to the inhibition of E2F (Dix, 2018; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). This group of genes is normally responsible for cell proliferation and therefore their inhibition causes senescence (Dix 2018). In addition to that, PP1 and PP2A directly interfere with Rb by dephosphorylating it (Dix 2018). These two phosphatases also inhibit the mTOR pathway that is associated with cell proliferation (Millner & Atilla-Gokcumen, 2020).\n\nSphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is thought to induce cell proliferation and migration by binding to S1PR1 and S1PR5. This is downregulated in senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018). In cellular senescence, S1P has been shown to be depleted as a result of a downregulation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), induced by p53. The downregulation of SK1 is thought to be due to its degradation induced by p53 (Kim et al., 2019). Moreover, S1P has hTERT as a direct target and promotes its stability (Magali et al., 2021). Furthermore, there is an increase in S1P binding to the S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2), which has been associated with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore the SASP. S1P is also thought to inhibit ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2), which catalyzes the conversion of sphingosine into ceramide (Magali et al., 2021). \n\nSphingosine is increased in senescence cells by the increase of S1P-phopshatase (SGPP1) and the increase in acid ceramidase ASAH-1 SGPP1 catalyzes the conversion of S1P to sphingosine, while ASAH-1 catalyzes the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine (Munk et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2019). This causes the dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, which further causes senescence (Trayssac et al., 2018).\n\nCeramide can be synthesized de novo starting with the conversion of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. Upregulation of ceramide synthase 4 (CERS4), which converts dihydro-sphingosine into dihydro-ceramide. CERS4 has been thought to be a key enzyme in two types of senescence: OIS and replicative senescence, by mediating its effects through the PP1-Rb-E2F axis (Dix, 2018)\n\nGalactosidase \u03b21 (GLB1) and in glucosylceramidase (GBA), which catalyze the conversion of lactosylceramide to glucosylceramide and the conversion of glucosylceramide to ceramide, respectively, are upregulated in cellular senescence. Additionally, there is a decrease in glucosylceramidase synthase, which catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide from ceramide (Flor et al., 2017).\n\nActivation of p53, due to DNA damage, leads to an increase of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase 2) (Deevska et al., 2021; Jeffries & Krupenko, 2018). Moreover, it has been noted that in senescent cells, there are elevated levels of neutral sphingomyelinases ( Millner & Atilla-Gokcumen, 2020). These enzymes catalyze the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide (Gey & Seeger, 2013).\n\nElevated ceramide levels result in elevated diacylglycerol (DAG) levels (Deevska et al., 2021). These two lipids are linked by sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SGMS2). SGMS2 catalyzes the transfer of a phosphorycholine group from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, yielding sphingomyelin and DAG.  In cellular senescence, SMS was found to be overexpressed. This caused an increase in DAG which caused the chronic activation of its downstream effectors. This causes the downregulation of protein kinase C \u03b1 and \u03b2 (PKC\u03b1 and \u03b2) via the prolonged activation of phospholipase C. The consequences of this is the activation of p53 and p38, leading to SASP and senescence (Deevska et al., 2021)."

The hydrophilic moieties in these amphipathic compounds may be as a simple as a single -OH at one end of the sterol ring system, or they may be more complex. Glycerophospholipds, as well as sphingolipids, contained polar or charged alcohols at their polar ends; some also contain phosphate groups.\n\nIn glycerophospholipids, two fatty acids are ester-linked to glycerol at C-1 and C-2, and a highly polar or charged (and therefore hydrophilic) head group is attached to C-3 through a phosphodiester bond. All glycerophospholipds are derivatives of phosphatidic acid and are named for their polar head groups (e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine). All have a negative charge on the phosphate group at pH 7.0. The head-goup alcohol may also contribute one or more charges at pH near 7.0. The fatty acids in glycerophospholipds can be any of a wide variety. They are different in different species, in different tissues of the same species, and in different types of glycerophospholipids in the same cell or tissue. In general, glycerophospholipids contain a saturated fatty acid at C-1 and an unsaturated fatty acid at C-2, and, in general terms, the fatty acyl groups are generally 16 or 18 carbons long.\n\nEukaryotic membranes contain significant amounts of two other types of glycerophospholipids: Plasmalogens and Alkylacylglycerophospholipids. Plasmalogens contain a hydrocarbon chain linked to glycerol C-1 via vinyl ether linkage whereas alkylacylglycerophospholipids the alkyl substituent at glycerol C-1 is attached via an ether linkage. About 20% of mammalian glycerophospholipids are plasmalogens, this percentage varies both from species to species and from tissue to tissue within a given organism. While plasmalogens comprise only about 0.8% of the phospholipids in human liver, they account for around 23% of those in human nervous tissue. The alkylacylglycerophospholipids are less abundant than the plasmalogens, e.g., about 59% of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids of human heart are plasmalogens, whereas only 3.6% are alkylacylglycerophospholipids. However, in bovine erythrocytes, 75% of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipids are of alkylacyl type."

Kinin peptides are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis, inflammatory processes, and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning.\nComplement is a system of plasma proteins that is activated by the presence of pathogens. There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement. The three main consequences of complement activation are the opsonization of pathogens, the recruitment of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, and the direct killing of pathogens.\nSource: KEGG \n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP558)"

At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP306)\n\nProtein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org."

Specific genes and mediators of metastasis have been identified, but it remains mostly unknown how cancer cells acquire these traits.\nMetastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output: These pathways demonstrate metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is augmented by VCAM-1 and SRC, leads to increased cell survival, a significant metastatic trait. Similarly, TCF augments the output of the NOTCH and, along with periostin, Wnt signaling pathways. As the signaling of these pathways increases, the metastatic and oncogenic potential of the cell also increase.\nMetastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output: This pathway demonstrates metastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output. Loss of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) in renal cell carcinoma leads to increased activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Histone H3K27 and CYTIP give the VHL-HIF pathway access to new target genes. Each of these new target genes, in this case CXCR4, VEGFA, and CYTIP, lead to an increase in a metastatic trait. Here, the level of metastatic fitness is not linearly proportional to pathway activity; rather, the pathway activates an additional set of factors that affect metastatic fitness.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3678)."

In this context, inhibiting Tankyrase 1/2 destabilizes \u03b2-catenin by promoting Axin stability, which in turn reduces the growth of \u03b2-catenin-dependent colorectal cancer cells.\n\nGSK3 kinase activity is a critical suppressor of \u03b2-catenin stability, and this activity is negatively regulated by mono-ADP-ribosylation mediated by PARP10, which results in elevated \u03b2-catenin levels. Moreover, PLK1 promotes \u03b2-catenin destabilization and is mono-ADP-ribosylated by PARP10.

The epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatrieneoic acid or EETs, are putative endothelial derived hyperpolarization factors which increase the open state probability of Ca++ sensitive K+ channels, leading to vasodilation in arteriolar beds.  The 11(12)-EET in particular appears to have potent functions in vasodilation, and are inhibitors of NFKb dependent inflammatory signalling, and PAI-1 activity.  The 5(6)-EET appears unique, in that its metabolic transformation through cyclooxygenase activities produces potent vasoconstrictors.  With the exception of the 5(6)-EET, these epoxy fatty acids are good substrates for the soluble epoxide hydrolase.  Hydrolytic tranformation to vicinal diols eliminates vasoactive actions, however these vicinal diols have been reported to have other biological activites, including PPAR-alpha activation.

    "pathwayDescription": "In fission yeast, the rad3 gene product plays a critical role in sensing DNA structure defects and activating damage response pathways. A structural homologue of rad3 in humans has been identified based on sequence similarity in the protein kinase domain.  ATR (for Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is considered the mammalian counterpart of yeast rad3, Mec1p, and fruit fly Mei-41, proteins involved in DNA damage responses.\nThe ATR protein is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase family and plays an important role in UV-induced DNA damage checkpoint response and its role as a signal transducer in cell cycle checkpoint has been well established.  Even though it is currently unclear whether ATR functions as a damage sensor, recent evidence shows that ATR may function as an initial sensor in the DNA damage checkpoint response.  Moreover, it has been found that ATR is a DNA-binding protein with higher affinity to UV-damaged than undamaged DNA.  In addition, damaged DNA stimulates the kinase activity of ATR to a significantly higher level than undamaged DNA.\nATR is structurally related to ATM (for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) as well as the yeast PIK family members Mec1p and Rad3.  Mec1p and Rad3 participate in checkpoint pathways induced by DNA replication blocks, DNA strand breaks, and other chromosomal abnormalities, which implies that ATR performs similar functions in mammalian cells.  Reports have demonstrated that overexpression of a catalytically inactive version of ATR (ATRki) in human fibroblasts caused hypersensitivity to gamma-radiation and hydroxyurea and abrogation of the radiation-induced G2 checkpoint.  The checkpoint defects observed in ATR-overexpressing cells resemble those found in AT cells.\nAdditionally, ATR functions as an upstream regulator of p53 phosphorylation in DNA-damaged cells.  ATR phosphorylates p53 at both Ser-15 and Ser-37 in vitro, suggesting that ATR is directly involved in the modification of p53 in DNA-damaged cells.  Recent reports concerning ATM, suggest that ATR and ATM play both overlapping and independent roles in the phosphorylation of p53 during cellular exposure to genotoxic stress.\nAtr is localized to the nuclei of primary spermatocytes, cells that are undergoing meiosis I.  It has been demonstrated that both Atr and Atm proteins have associated protein kinase activity, consistent with their primary structures.  Additionally, Atr and Atm show specific association with chromosomes in cells that are in early meiosis I as demonstrated by antibody localization on surface-spread spermatocytes.  Both the Atr and Atm proteins are present at pairing forks in meiotic prophase as chromosomes synapse; however, they do not colocalize, instead they occupy complementary positions: Atr localizes along unsynapsed chromosome axes and Atm interacts with synapsed axes.\nMeanwhile ATM is activated by damage-induced rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation prior relocalization to sites of DNA breaks, ATR activation seems to require single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) coated with replication protein A.  The recruitment of ATR to damage sites appears to be mediated by an ATR-interacting protein that forms a stable complex with the vast majority of ATR in human cells."

The signaling pathway is critical to induction of type I interferons (INF-I) via IRF3, AP-1 and NFkB transcription factors.

    "pathwayDescription": "Astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle in Homo sapiens. The pathway shows the relation between neuronal activity and lactate production in astrocytes. These shuttles show how lactate can be broken down by lactate dehydrogenase into pyruvate which enters the TCA cycle in neurons. \nIn astrocytes, glucose undergoes glycolysis to be converted into pyruvate, which is then converted into lactate with the help of the LDHA enzyme. Lactate is then transported from astrocytes to neurons through the transporters SLC16A1, SLC16A3 and SLC16A7. There, lactate is converted to pyruvate with the help of the LDHB enzyme. Pyruvate formation is also increased by glucose entering the neuron through the SLC2A3 transporter, which undergoes glycolysis. Pyruvate enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondria of the neuron and ATP is produced. \nThe ATP generated in the neurons is required for the glutamate neurotransmitters to be excreted from neurons into the synaptic cleft. Astrocytes take up the glutamate neurotransmitters through the transporter SLC1A2. For glutamate to be transported into the cell by the SLC1A2 transporter, Na\u207a must be cotransported into the cell. This increase in concentration of sodium ions inside the astrocyte is balanced by Na\u207a/K\u207a ATPase which transports Na\u207a out of the cell while simultaneously transporting K\u207a into the cell. This transporter requires ATP to be activated, and the ADP produced can be regenerated into ATP during glycolysis in the astrocytes. \nThis lactate shuttle theory explains that lactate from astrocytes is preferentially used over glucose by neurons in a fully aerobic state and is the main supply of energy to our neurological system."

    "pathwayDescription": "In celiac disease, gluten peptides breach the intestinal epithelial barrier and are deamidated by tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2). These modified peptides are presented on HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 molecules by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to the activation of gluten-specific CD4\u207a T cells. Once activated, these T cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-21, and TNF-\u03b1, which contribute to small-intestinal mucosal damage, in part by acting alongside IL-15 secreted by inflamed epithelial cells.\n\nIntraepithelial cytotoxic CD8\u207a T cells are also activated, releasing granzyme B (GZMB) and IFN-\u03b3, amplifying the cycle of inflammation. In the periphery, gluten-specific memory CD4\u207a T cells remain vigilant and rapidly respond to gluten exposure\u2014within 6 hours\u2014by releasing inflammatory mediators like IL-2.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that bacterial or viral infections may disrupt oral tolerance to gluten. Current therapeutic approaches under investigation target multiple stages of CeD pathogenesis:\n\n* Glutenases and anti-gliadin antibody AGY degrade or neutralize gluten;\n\n* Integrin antagonists and tight junction modulators aim to restore epithelial barrier integrity;\n\n* TG2 inhibitors block gluten peptide deamidation;\n\n* Anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suppress IL-15\u2013driven inflammation;\n\n* CD4\u207a T cell\u2013targeted therapies seek to inhibit the expansion of pathogenic gluten-specific T cells;\n\n* Tolerance-inducing strategies aim to delete or anergize gluten-specific CD4\u207a T cells or promote their differentiation into regulatory T cells (Tregs)."

    "pathwayDescription": "The Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is an anterior pituitary gonadotropin belonging to the family of glycoprotein hormones that includes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Leutinizing Hormone (LH) and Chorionic Gonadotropin. FSH controls the growth and maturation of follicles in the females and spermatogenesis in males. FSH is a heterodimer and shares a common alpha sub-unit with the other glycoprotein hormones in its family and has a specific beta subunit that confers receptor specificity and biological activity to the hormone. FSH acts through the FSH receptor (FSHR), a G protein coupled receptor  that is expressed exclusively on the granulosa cells of ovaries and Sertoli cells of the testis  in humans. FSH signaling involves activation of adenylyl cyclase activity and the increased production of cAMP. This activates the cAMP dependent protein kinases such as PKA, PKB and PKC that, in turn, lead to the phosphorylation of specific transcription factors such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). In addition to activation of PI3K/Akt module, PKA also induces p38 mapk which, in turn, controls other kinase cascades. Activated Akt also induces the mTOR axis that stimulates mRNA translation by phosphorylating p70 S6 kinase and, consequently, the 40 S ribosomal protein S6 that results in the activation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. It also indirectly aids in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs). FSH induces important genes required for steroidogenesis as well as growth and maturation of germ cells. The important target genes include aromatase (CYP19A1), the lutenizing hormone receptor (LHR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/fsh_pathway.html) database.\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper: Telikicherla, D., Ambekar, A., Palapetta, S.

    "pathwayDescription": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also known as ErbB1/HER1 is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases \nwhich also includes ErbB2 (Neu, HER2), ErbB3 (HER3) and ErbB4 (HER4). Several ligands such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha, epigen, \namphiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF and epiregulin are known to specifically bind to EGFR. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the high affinity \nligands of EGFR. EGF/EGFR system induces growth, differentiation, migration, adhesion and cell survival through various inter-acting signaling pathways. The binding of \nEGF to the extracellular domain of EGFR induces the dimerization, activation of intrinsic kinase activity and subsequent autophosphorylation of EGFR at multiple residues \nin the cytoplasmic region such as Tyr 1092, Tyr 1172, Tyr 1197, Tyr 1110, Tyr 1016). Activated EGFR recruits various cytoplasmic proteins which transduce and regulate the \nEGFR function. The proteins recruited to active EGFR include many Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain containing proteins which binds to the \ntyrosine phosphorylated residues in EGFR, enzymes which act on EGFR and also various EGFR substrates. One of the adapter proteins, GRB2, binds to the phosphotyrosine \nresidue at 1068 and recruits SOS to the membrane. SOS activates GDP/GTP exchange which recruits RAF to the membrane. RAF phosphorylates MEKs, which then activates the \nextracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK). ERK activates a number of transcriptional regulators to induce cell growth and proliferation. GRB2 or other adaptor proteins \nsuch as GABs recruits PI3Ks, another major mediator of EGFR signaling. PI3Ks convert Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). \nPIP3 binds to PH domain of AKT and recruits it to plasma membrane. PDK1 phosphorylates AKT which in turn regulate the activity of various proteins that mediate cell \nsurvival. EGFR also activate phospholipase C which hydrolyses PIP2 to generate Inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 induces the release of Ca2+ \nfrom endoplasmic reticulum to activate calcium regulated pathways. DAG activates protein kinase C pathway. One of the signaling modules regulated by PKC in EGFR pathway is \nthe NFKB module. The protein SRC is a key player in the activation of various pathways such as RAS, PLC and also the STAT proteins in various cells. Other signaling modules \nactivated by EGFR include the FAK, JNK, p38MAPK and ERK5 modules. EGFR induces the JNK pathway through the activation of G proteins such as RAC and CDC42 which recruits JNK \nkinases as well as regulate the actin polymerization.  EGFR also translocates from the plasma  membrane to other cellular compartments including nucleus where it directly \nregulate the expression of several genes in cooperation with other transcriptional regulators such as STATs, PCNA and E2F family of proteins. Being a growth, differentiation \nand cell survival factor; mutations and overexpression of EGFR and also the defective regulation of its signal transduction pathways has been established to be associated \nwith oncogenesis. Thus, EGFR and its signaling components are promising targets for effective therapy for various cancers. There are several proteins which have been reported \nto regulate the EGFR signaling such as CBL, CSK, PKC and PTEN which promotes endocytosis or reduction in the EGFR activity or its signaling mediators. The major endocytic pathway \nof EGFR is established to be the clathrin coated pits which delivers them to endosomes. The endosomal pathway recycles the membraneous form of EGFR or form multivesicular bodies (MVB) \nand fuse with lysosomes for to the degradation pathway.\n\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/EGFR1_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP4659",
    "pathwayDescription": "Gastrin is a peptide hormone which is involved in the process of gastric acid secretion. Gastrin release is induced by the gastrin-releasing peptide, a neurotransmitter acting on its basolateral receptor in G-cells. Gastrin is then translocated to the oxyntic mucosa in an endocrine manner where it binds to its receptor CCKBR in parietal and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. This interaction stimulates secretion of gastric acid by parietal cells and release of histamine by ECL cells. Histamine reaches parietal cells through paracrine diffusion where it binds H2 receptors and induces gastric acid secretion. Gastrin has been reported to stimulate proliferation of gastric mucosal cells,maturation of parietal cells and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, and promote islet differentiation in the pancreas. Gastrin is also known to stimulate the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells. Produced as preprogastrin of 101 amino acids by the human G-cells of the antrum of stomach, it is sequentially cleaved to first yield progastrin and then 35-amino acid gastrin-34-Gly or an 18-amino acid gastrin-17-Gly that are often amidated.\n\nCCKAR and CCKBR cholecystokinin receptors belonging to the family of G-protein coupled receptors, are the best characterized receptors of Gastrin. CCKBR has high affinity for gastrin and their carboxyl amidated analogues, while the CCKAR has been reported to have negligible affinity. Gq-alpha had been the major identified G-alpha subunit involved in gastrin signaling. Gastrin induces the activation of Gq-alpha and regulates the levels of IP3 and DAG through PLC-gamma1 mediated hydrolysis of PIP2. SRC has also been shown to be involved in this regulation. SRC kinase is also involved in the activation of classical RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways through IRS1-mediated recruitment of GRB2/SHC1/SOS complex and regulatory subunits of PI3Ks, respectively. PI3K pathway activation by SRC also involves the formation of SRC-FAK complexes. Gastrin induced MEK/ERK pathway is also reported to be mediated through PKCs. Gastrins have also been reported to regulate the activation of Rho, Rac and Cdc42 pathways. Recently, Liu and Jose 2013 have reported the regulation of MTOR and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 activities through a PI3K/PKC-dependent but AKT-independent pathway. Both p38MAPK and JNKs are also reported to be involved in gastrin signaling. PKAs as well as PKCs are involved in the regulation of p38MAPK activation whereas JNK activation has been shown to be mediated by MAP3K11 (MLK3). Gastrin induces the activation of eNOS and thereby nitric oxide production in ERK1/2, AKT, and p38MAPK dependent manner. Another major pathway involved in gastrin induced cell proliferation and migration is the beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway. JAK-STAT pathway has also been shown to be involved in gastrin signaling. Interestingly, JAK2 activation has been identified to be also involved in activation of PI3K pathway.\n\nApart from CCKAR and CCKBR, recently gastrin has also been shown to bind to Annexin A2 to mediate their effects. Thus far, gastrin induced activation of NFKBs, ERKs and p38MAPK have been reported to be mediated by both CCK receptor(s) as well as Annexin A2 in multiple cells/cell types.\nVisit: http://www.netpath.org/netslim/Gastrin_pathway.html"

    "pathwayDescription": "The Hedgehog family of proteins are signaling proteins that are crucial for a number of physiological processes including morphogenesis during development. In adult organisms, it is also involved in the regulation of theca cell development in growing follicles and in regulating the development and function of the somatic cells of the testis. Vertebrates are known to have 3 Hedgehog genes, which show different spatio-temporal expression patterns and perform specialized functions. These are - Desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh). The Patched (PTCH) proteins (Patched 1 and Patched 2 - PTCH1 and PTCH2) serve as receptors for the Hedgehog proteins. In the 'off' state, PTCH receptors inhibit the Smo protein by mechanism(s) which are still not understood completely. In this state, the Gli2/3 Zn-finger transcription factors are phosphorylated and processed in a proteasome-dependent manner to generate a transcriptionally repressor form. SUFU, a cytoplasmic protein, was also found to interact with all the three Gli proteins resulting in the repression of its transcriptional activity. In the 'Signaling cell', which is the cell which secretes the Hedgehog proteins, an active ligand is produced following processing of the precursor Hedgehog protein. This processing involves autocleavage by the catalytic domain and bi-lipidation (cholesterol moiety at C-terminus and palmitate at the N-terminus) of the Hedgehog protein. These active ligands travel to the 'responding cell' via interactions with glypicans and megalin. On the responding cell, the active ligand interacts with PATCHED 1 (PTCH1) and PATCHED 2 (PTCH2), which results in the activation and translocation of Smoothed (Smo) to the cilium(plasma membrane in Drosophila). Activation of Smo results in the inhibition of Gli proteolysis and the production of the transcriptional repressor form. This might also promote the formation of the transcription activator form of the protein. The G-protein coupled receptor kinase-2 enhances the association between \u03b2-arrestin 2 and Smo probably by phosphorylating Smo. The two proteins also mediates increased internalization of Smo in a clathrin- dependent process and increased Hedgehog signaling. Kif7, a Drosophila Costal2 (Cos2) homolog, is capable of interacting with the Gli proteins and is known to exert positive and negative effects on Hedgehog signaling. The Fused (Fu) homolog, which can form a complex with Kif7, Gli and and SuFu (similar to Drosophila Gli, Cos2, Su and SuFu) may also be involved in the regulation of this pathway.\n\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/hedgehog_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and Doss porphyria (ALADP) are all part of the acute-hepatic porphyrias. This type is often associated with an overproduction of neurotoxic porphyrins and porphyrin precursors.\n \nThe non-acute porphyrias include porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic porphyria, and congenital erythropoietic porphyria. These diseases are instead characterised by photosensitivity of the skin and in severe cases liver damage, caused by porphyrins. Another type of porphyria are the X-linked protoporphyria diseases, which are a result of a gain of function mutation in the 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 gene. This causes an accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. \nThe disease present in the patient is determined by what enzyme is affected in the heme biosynthesis pathway.\nThis pathway has been constructed using chapter 33 of the book; Physician's Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (first edition), by N.Blau et al (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361))."

The non-canonical TGFB pathway involves the calcium-calneurin signaling pathway that also affects those functions. The TGFBR complex also activates SHCA and Tak1, which promote the function of a complex (ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38) to regulate the previously mentioned cell functions and influence the development of cardiovascular diseases. These diseases are additionally influenced by a signaling pathway involving the activation of TGFB ligands, receptors, activators, and effectors by ANG2/AT1/2R complex.

    "pathwayDescription": "IL-2 is a multifunctional cytokine with pleiotropic effects on several cells of the immune system. IL-2 was originally discovered as a T cell growth factor, but it was also found to have actions related to B cell proliferation, and cytolytic activity of natural killer cells. IL-2 also activates lymphokine activated killer cells. In contrast to its proliferative effects, IL-2 also has potent activity in a process known as activation-induced cell death. More recently, IL-2 was shown to promote tolerance through its effects on regulatory T cell development. IL-2 clinically has anti-cancer effects as well as utility in supporting T cell numbers in HIV/AIDS. There are three classes of IL-2 receptors, binding IL-2 with low, intermediate, or high-affinity. The low affinity receptor (IL-2R\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b1 alone) is not functional; signaling by IL-2 involves either the high affinity hetero-trimeric receptor containing IL-2R\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b1, IL-2R\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (originally named IL-2R\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3 and now generally denoted as \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3c) or the intermediate affinity heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-2R\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 and \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3c. IL-2 stimulation induces the activation of the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3, which associate with IL-2R\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 and \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3c, respectively. These kinases in turn phosphorylate IL-2R\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and various other downstream targets. The downstream signaling pathways activated by IL-2 also involves mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling modules, leading to both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals.\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_2_pathway.html) database.

    "pathwayDescription": "Endochondral ossification is the process by which the embryonic cartilaginous model of most bones contributes to longitudinal growth and is gradually replaced by bone. During endochondral ossification, chondrocytes proliferate, undergo hypertrophy and die; the cartilage extracellular matrix they construct is then invaded by blood vessels, osteoclasts, bone marrow cells and osteoblasts, the last of which deposit bone on remnants of cartilage matrix. The sequential changes in chondrocyte behaviour are tightly regulated by both systemic factors and locally secreted factors, which act on receptors to effect intracellular signalling and activation of chondrocyte-selective transcription factors. Systemic factors that regulate the behaviour of chondrocytes in growth cartilage include growth hormone and thyroid hormone, and the local secreted factors include Indian hedgehog, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, fibroblast growth factors and components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Transcription factors that play critical roles in regulation of chondrocyte gene expression under the control of these extracellular factors include Runx2, Sox9 and MEF2C. The invasion of cartilage matrix by the ossification front is dependent on its resorption by members of the matrix metalloproteinase family, as well as the presence of blood vessels and bone-resorbing osteoclast (Mackie et al.)\n\nThyroid hormone and especially triiodothyronine induce morphological hypertrophy of chondrocytes, through binding to thyroid hormone receptors. Further, triiodothyronine increases the total collagen production in chondrocytes, as also terminal differentiation, but triiodothyronine also induces cell death through non-apoptotic modes of physiological death. Triiodothyronine acts by altering intracellular gene expression after receptor binding, and is crucial for growth, as receptor deficiencies lead to dwarfism and growth retardation. Thyroid hormone inhibits the PTHR1 gene, which encodes for a g-protein coupled receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-like hormones. PTH receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. They control the levels of calcium in the blood and thus, ossification as they inhibit hypertrophy upon activation (Mackie, Randau, [rarediseases.org](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/jansen-type-metaphyseal-chondrodysplasia/)).\nOxygen acts upon RUNX2 and HDAC4 in the ossification process. HDAC4 is a class II histone deacetylase/acuc/apha family gene, and if tethered to a promoter, it represses transcription ([ncbigene:9759](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9759)). Via this mechanism, HDAC4 represses RUNX2 in the ossification process. RUNX2 is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors, encoding a nuclear protein with an RUND DNA-binding domain. It induces osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis, as it acts upon the DNA and regulatory factors ([ncbigene:860](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/860]). Thus, RUNX2 acts directly upon chondrocytical hypertrophy. \nCyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) act upon protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins if activated. In this case it leads to the inhibition of Sox9 (doi:[10.1038/nm.3314](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3314)). Sox9 induces cell proliferation and inhibits hypertrophy and is regulating the transcription of the anti-m\u00c3\u00bcllerian hormone.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP474)"

The first step of the pathway is the phosphorylation of galactose by galactokinase (encoded GALK1) to yield galactose 1-phosphate. Conversion of galactose 1-phosphate to G1P requires the transfer of UDP from UDP-glucose catalyzed by GALT. UDP-galactose is converted to UDP-glucose by GALE. Glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and vice versa.\nThere are two known disorders concerning the uptake transports of galactose (SGLT1 and GLUT2 deficiency) and three known disorders of galactose metabolism: galactokinase deficiency (GALK-D), galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency (galactosemia, GALT-D) and uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase deficiency (GALE-D).\nAmong these, galactosemia is the most common and most severe.

    "pathwayDescription": "Interleukin 5 (IL-5) ligand belongs to the cytokine superfamily. IL-5 is a glycoprotein which belongs to the cytokine superfamily. It possesses the four helical bundle motifs that is conserved among several hematopoietic cytokines. IL-5 plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils. IL-5 induces terminal maturation of eosinophils, prolongs eosinophils survival by delaying apoptotic death, increases eosinophils adhesion to endothelial cells and enhances eosinophils effector function. IL-5 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of asthma, hypereosinophilic syndromes and eosinophil-dependent inflammatory diseases. IL-5 is produced by eosinophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, Tc2 cells and gamma delta T cells. IL-5 exerts influence on different biological activities by associating with the IL-5 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex consisting of an alpha chain-IL5RA and a beta chain, CSF2RB, which is shared between IL-5 receptor, IL-3 receptor and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor. Binding of IL-5 to the receptor complex results in the recruitment of adapter proteins including SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1. This leads to the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Subsequent activation of transcription factors including JUN and ELK-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. IL-5 stimulation also resulted in the activation of PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathway resulting in the phosphorylation of RPS6 and regulation of gene expression. JAK phosphorylation and activation is also brought about by IL-5, which in turn results in the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins. The STAT transcription factors are responsible for the expression of early response genes and feedback inhibitor of JAK/STAT pathway. In addition, IL-5 is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, BTK and SYK. The interactions and intersections between canonical and non-canonical IL-5 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.\n\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_5_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

The Notch proteins (Notch1-Notch4 in vertebrates) are single-pass receptors that are activated by the Delta (or Delta-like) and Jagged/Serrate families of membrane-bound ligands. They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL. Components of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HATs), are recruited to the NICD-CSL complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP268)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Proteoglycan (PG) synthesis is a complex mechanism that can be divided in four main steps. Core protein synthesis occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Once PG core protein has been synthesized, it moves from the RER to the Golgi apparatus where the first sugar of glycosaminoalycan (GAG) chain is added on Ser residues. GAG synthesis continues by glycosyltransferases that transfer sugar moieties from UDP-sugars to GAG chains. UDP-sugars are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are translocated in the Golgi apparatus by an antiporter with UMP. Then UDP, the by-product of glycosyltransferase reactions, is hydrolyzed to UMP and phosphate by calcium activated nucleotidase 1 (CANT1). Chondroitin, dermatan and heparan sulfate synthesis starts on a Ser residue of the PG core protein with the formation of a tetrasaccharide linkage region composed of a xylose (Xyl), two galactoses (Gal) and a glucuronic acid (GlcUA). After tetrasaccharide synthesis, GAG chain elongation continues through the binding of specific saccharides defining chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Specific enzymes are involved in this process and mutations in their gene cause different types of skeletal dysplasia (indicated in red boxes). The third step is GAG sulfation.  Sulfate enters in cells through the SLC26A2 transporter and it is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by PAPS synthase (PAPSS) in the cytosol. Through a PAPS transporter (PAPST), PAPS moves to Golgi apparatus where it is used as sulfate donor by sulfotransferases to sulfate GAGs. This reaction also produces phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), that is hydrolyzed into AMP and phosphate by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase (gPAPP). Once synthesized, PGs are secreted in extracellular space.\n\nSulfation of GAGs is an important step in PG synthesis determining PG properties. Inorganic sulfate enters in cells through a sulfate/chloride antiporter named SLC26A2, but a small amount of sulfate could be derived from sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. To be used by Golgi sulfotransferases, sulfate is activated to 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosulfate (PAPS), the universal sulfate donor, by PAPS synthase (PAPSS2). The by-product of sulfotransferase reactions, phosphoadenosine phosphate (PAP), is hydrolyzed by a Golgi resident phosphoadenosine phosphate phosphatase (gPAPP) in order to prevent feedback inhibition of these reactions.\n\nLinked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are skeletal dysplasias caused by mutation in the respective gene.\n\nFor further details, see [Paganini et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31286677)."

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP61",
    "pathwayDescription": "The Notch pathway is an evolutionally conserved signaling pathway which plays an important role in diverse developmental and physiological processes. These include cell-fate determination, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation and cell death. The Notch pathway is named after the Drosophila mutants that showed irregular notches of missing tissue at the insect wing blade tips. The Notch gene was cloned in 1985. Proteins of the Notch families are single-pass transmembrane proteins that function both as cell surface receptors and nuclear transcriptional regulators. Four Notch receptors (Notch 1-4) have been identified in mammals. Mature Notch receptors are non-covalent heterodimers consisting of an extracellular subunit (NEC) and a transmembrane subunit (NTM). NEC possess multiple EGF-like repeats and three specialized Lin-Notch repeats (LNR) that forms a tight hydrophobic interaction with extracellular stump of NTM. This region masks an A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) cleavage site. The region where these two subunits interact is called the heterodimerization domain (HD). Notch ligands are also transmembrane proteins with multiple EGF-like repeats, a short cytoplasmic tail and a specialized delta-serrate-lag2 (DSL) domain at the N-terminus. There are five canonical Notch ligands i.e. Jagged (JAG1 and JAG2), Delta-like (DLL1, DLL3, DLL4) in mammals. Notch signaling activation occurs upon ligand-receptor binding, which are expressed on two adjacent cells. Ligand binding causes dissociation of NEC from NTM, unmasking the ADAM cleavage site. The NEC fragment is trans- endocytosed into the ligand expressing cells. The full-length receptor minus the NEC fragment is cleaved at the membrane by ADAM17 generating an intermediate, Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT). This is further cleaved by \u00ce\u00b3-secretase that generates an active Notch intracellular fragment (NIC) or Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The \u00ce\u00b3-secretase complex is composed of PSEN1, PSEN2, PSENEN, NCSTN and APH1 (A or B). Following these two cleavage steps, the NICD is released into the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription of Notch target genes. Upon translocation into the nucleus, NICD binds to RBPJ which is a constitutive repressor of Notch signaling. RBPJ represses Notch target gene expression by recruiting a co-repressor complex, which includes NCOR1, NCOR2, SNW1, CIR, HDAC1, HDAC2, SPEN and FHL1 and SAP30. NICD binding to RBPJ replaces the co-repressor complex with a co-activator complex which includes MAML1-3, EP300 and SNW1. Primary Notch target genes include two families of transcriptional factors Hes, including HES1 and HES5 as well as Hey including HEY1 and HEY2. Other Notch target genes include CCND1, CDKN1A, GATA3 and PTCRA. CNTN1 acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction causes \u00ce\u00b3-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the NICD. This signaling is involved in oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulation of myelin-related protein MAG. In addition to the canonical Notch pathway, there is increasing evidence showing RBPJ independent non-canonical pathways. been fully characterized. Physical interaction of NOTCH-1IC with LCK- PI3K may mediate non-nuclear cross-talk with AKT, leading to survival signaling. Notch stimulation through AKT pathway leads to down regulation of MYC expression. Activation of SRC/STAT3 pathway by Notch signaling is dependent on the expression of Notch effector HES1 transcription factor. The induction of HES1 enhanced SRC phosphorylation. This activated SRC kinase was found to be responsible for the enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3. The HES1 and HES5 proteins associate with and facilitate the complex formation between JAK2 and STAT3, thus promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. The activated STAT3 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces transcriptional activation of target gene expression (including HIF1A).\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/notch_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

The antigen binding subunit is the membrane bound immunoglobulin and the signaling subunit consists of the Ig\u00ce\u00b1 and Ig\u00ce\u00b2 proteins, which are covalently bound to each other. Both Ig\u00ce\u00b1 and Ig\u00ce\u00b2 proteins have an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based activation motif (ITAM) each in its cytoplasmic region, which is responsible for the initiation and propagation of signaling. Antigen binding to the immunoglubulin results in the aggregation of both the immunoglobulin and the Ig\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b2 subunits. This results in the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the ITAM motif of the Ig\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b2 subunits by the src-family of protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The Src family kinases are initially in the proximity of the BCR as a result of membrane anchoring by virtue of its their acetylation.

This association is further enhanced upon BCR engagement as a result of accumulation in BCR containing lipid rafts and SH2 domain mediated binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues in ITAMs. This increased association helps in amplifying the BCR mediated signaling. Doubly phosphorylated Ig\u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b2 ITAMs are necessary for efficient recruitment of Syk and its activation. Activated Syk then phsophorylates the adapter molecule B cell linker protein (BLNK), which acts as molecular scaffold for the recruitment of multiple effectors and hence the propagation of multiple signaling pathways. BLNK binds to Btk and PLC\u00ce\u00b32 which results in optimal phosphorylation and activation of PLC. This is an important mechanism which links BCR to Ca2+ signaling. Apart from the PLC mediated Ca2+ signaling, BCR triggering also results in the the activaion of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K). This activation takes place through the recruitment of p85 adaptor subunit of PI-3K to CD19 co-receptor, which is phosphorylated by Lyn on its cytoplasmic Y-X-X-M motif. Alternatively, PI-3K can be recruited to the plasma membrane by other adapter molecules including PIK3AP, CBL or GAB1/2. PI-3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidyl inositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate. Akt, a serine threonine kinase, is recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of its N-terminal PH-domain where it is activated by conformational changes and phosphorylation. Activated Akt phosphorylates several substrates resulting in diverse physiological consequences: Forkhead transcription factors - resulting in its degradation and hence inhibition of expression of pro-apoptotic genes, glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK3 -leading to its inhibition and hence regulation of cell-cycle. The tanscription factor NF-kappaB is also found to be activated in BCR signaling in a Btk, PI-3K and PKC dependent manner. \nBCR engagement can also result in the association of GRB2/SOS complex with either SHC or BLNK, which results in the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. This cascade leads to the activation of transcription factors including ELK and MYC. BCR activation also results in the activation of JNKs and p38MAPK.\n\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/bcr_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

    "pathwayDescription": "Kit is a cytokine receptor that belongs to the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. It is structurally similar to platelet-derived growth factor recpetors (PDGFRs), colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and fms-like tyrosine kinase. Kit signaling is plays important role in a number of physiological processes including erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, mast cell development and function, megakaryopoiesis, gametogenesis and melanogenesis. Sequence alterations in the c-kit gene are found to be associated with different cancers including hematopoietic malignancies, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, germ cell tumors, small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. The primary ligand for kit receptor is stem cell factor (SCF). It is also known as Kit ligand, steel factor or mast cell growth factor. SCF is a glycosylated, non-covalent homodimer. Alternative splicing and proteolytic cleavage results in soluble and membrane bound forms of the protein. that binds to two KIT monomers. Binding of SCF to KIT results in the dimerization of the receptor and its autophsphorylation. The residues that are known to get phosphorylated upon ligand binding include Tyr568, Tyr570, Tyr703, Tyr721, Tyr730, Tyr823, Tyr 900 and Tyr936. Signaling events downstream of the KIT receptor are well studied. Among the signaling cascades that are activated are the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT/RPS6K pathways. KIT stimulation is also known to activate the JAK/STAT and PLC/PKC signaling pathways. Among the other key proteins that are regulated by KIT are the kinases BTK, TEC, LYN, SRC, FYN and JNK. Regulation of KIT receptor tyrosine kinase occurs through many mechanisms. Activated KIT receptors are degraded via CBL, a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. CBL induces the degradation of the receptor via the proteasome or lysosome. KIT can also be dephosphorylated and inactivated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp1. Also, activation of protein kinase C results in a negative feedback loop, wherein it phosphorylates specific serine residues leading to the inactivation of KIT. \n  \nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/kit_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

Low-invasive ovarian cancer (OVCA) cells are glucose dependent for their TCA cycle pool.

In low-invasive OVCA cells, glucose activates Jak1, which activates STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation, thereby regulating glycolysis in cancer cells. In highinvasive OVCA cells, besides glucose's role in activating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, glutamine activates JAK1 through TCA cycle to further activate STAT3 by tyrosine phosphorylation and thus regulate glycolysis. Further, Gln activates Erk1/2, which subsequently activates STAT3 by serine phosphorylation selectively in high-invasive OVCA cells. The serine phosphorylation of STAT3 enhances oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by interaction with mitochondrial complexes I and II, thereby increasing TCA cycle activity in high-invasive OVCA cells.

The transducers interact with the intracellular multisubstrate docking site of MET either directly, such as GRB2, SHC, SRC, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, or indirectly through the scaffolding protein GAB1.\nPhosphorylation of Tyr1349 and Tyr1356 of the multisubstrate docking site mediates interaction with GAB1, SRC, and SHC, while only Tyr 1356 is involved in the recruitment of GRB2, phospholipase C \u03b3 (PLC-\u03b3), p85, and SHP2. \nGAB1 is a key coordinator of the cellular responses to MET and binds the MET intracellular region with high avidity, but low affinity. Upon interaction with MET, GAB1 becomes phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues which, in turn, recruit a number of signaling effectors, including PI3K, SHP2, and PLC-\u03b3.

Persistent inflammatory conditions observed in Post-Covid patients potentially upregulate the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzymes, specifically IDO 1, as well as KMO, which catalyses the conversion from Kynurenine to 3-Hydroxykynurenine. Thus, the kynurenine pathway relates to PACS and potentially enables future biomarker and therapeutic possibilities. "

The overexpression of HER-2/neu (ERBB2) and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene (CDKN2A) at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes.

    "pathwayDescription": "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as \"non-homologous\" because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template, in contrast to homologous recombination, which requires a homologous sequence to guide repair. NHEJ involves binding of the KU heterodimer to double-stranded DNA ends, recruitment of DNA-PKcs (MRX complex in yeast), processing of ends, and recruitment of the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)-XRCC4 complex, which brings about ligation.\n\nNHEJ typically utilizes short homologous DNA sequences called microhomologies to guide repair. These microhomologies are often present in single-stranded overhangs on the ends of double-strand breaks. When the overhangs are perfectly compatible, NHEJ usually repairs the break accurately. Imprecise repair leading to loss of nucleotides can also occur, but is much more common when the overhangs are not compatible. Inappropriate NHEJ can lead to translocations and telomere fusion, hallmarks of tumor cells. NHEJ is evolutionarily conserved throughout all kingdoms of life and is the predominant double-strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells.\n\nAdapted from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-homologous_end_joining), [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03450), and [REPAIRtoire](http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/8/).\n\nThis pathway is part the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP438)."

    "pathwayTitle": "T-cell receptor signaling",
    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP69",
    "pathwayDescription": "The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex is composed of a ligand-binding subunit, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, and a signaling subunit, namely the CD3\u03b5, \u03b3 and \u03b4 chains and the TCR\u03b6 chain. This complex participates in T-cell activation upon the presentation of the antigen peptide (derived from the foreign antigen) bound to the MHC (Class I and Class II) residing on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells. Co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD2, CD28, CD4, CD8, and integrin molecules, contribute to signal transduction by modulating the response threshold. All the above components along with accessory proteins essential for MHC are a part of the immunological synapse that initiates T-cell activation.\n\nProtein tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, in turn regulated by CD45, is the initial event in TCR signaling. Lck is activated by the interaction of MHC and CD4 or CD8. It then induces the phosphorylation and activation of TCR-CD3 complex and eventually mediates Fyn activation. The activated Src kinases phosphorylate ITAMs (Immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) present on CD3\u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5 and \u03b6 chain. The 70-kd \u03b6 chain\u2013associated protein kinase (ZAP70) is then recruited to the ITAMs followed by its phosphorylation and subsequent activation which results in further amplification of the response. These activated PTKs induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides, including the transmembrane adaptor LAT (Linker Activator for T-Cells). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation subsequently leads to the activation of multiple pathways, including ERK (Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), NF-\u03baB (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1) and NFAT(Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells) pathways, which ultimately induce effector functions.\n\nCD28 ligation by B7-1 or B7-2 helps in bringing the T-Cell and Antigen Presenting Cell membranes into close proximity. This event also provides a co-stimulatory signal leading to the production of IL-2 and T- cell activation. Besides CD28, many other transmembrane receptors also modulate specific elements of TCR signaling. CD28 and CD45 activate Lck which in turn induces the phosphorylation and activation of the TCR-CD3 complex and consequently, the tyrosine kinases Fyn and ZAP70. CD45 plays a role in antagonizing the effect of inhibitory proteins on T-cell activation. ZAP70 induces activation of LAT (Linker for Activation of T-Cells), an integral membrane adaptor protein which further binds to GADS (Growth Factor Receptor-Bound Protein-2-Related Adaptor Protein-2), SLP76 (SH2 Domain-Containing Leukocyte Protein-76), and ITK (IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase). This complex facilitates the activation of PLCG1 (Phospholipase-C-Gamma1) that is responsible for the production of the second messengers DAG (Diacylglycerol) and IP3 (Inositol Triphosphate). DAG activates proteins including PKC\u03b8 (Protein Kinase-C-Theta) and Ras, whereas IP3 leads to Ca2+ release from ER and also facilitates influx of extracellular calcium. Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates the phosphatase Calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT which then enters the nucleus and promotes transcription.\n\nActivated LAT also binds multiple adaptor proteins including GRB2, GRAP (GRB2- Related Adaptor Protein) and GADS to facilitate activation of serine/threonine kinases such as Raf1, MEK (MAPK/ERK Kinase) and dual-specificity kinases ERK1/2 that are involved in activation of MAPKs (Mitogen activated protein kinases) resulting in the induction of transcription factor Elk1.\n\nZAP70 also activates IKKs via the CARD11 (Caspase recruitment domain family, member 11) -BCL10 (B-Cell CLL/lymphoma-10)-MALT1 (Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation Gene-1) complex and MAP3K (activated by PKC\u03b8) which in turn relieve NF-\u03baB of I\u03baB (NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta) and allow its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. ZAP70 also activates p38 via Vav, Rac and MKK3/6 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-3 / Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-6). p38 then activates the transcription factor ATF2 (Activating Transcription Factor-2).  Activated Rac also activates JNK via MEKK1 and MKK4/7 (MKK4 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-4/ Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase-7) which eventually leads to activation of c-Jun mediated transcription.\n\nSIT (SHP2-Interacting Transmembrane Adaptor Protein) and CTLA4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4) are transmembrane adaptor proteins that interact with the SHP2 (SH2-containing Protein tyrosine Phosphatase-2) and negatively regulate T-cell activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Fyn and CD28 respectively. CTLA4 has a greater affinity for its B7-1/B7-2ligands in comparison toCD28 and thus competes for them. During T-cell activation CTLA4 is endocytosed to quicken the response. ZAP70 facilitates translocation of CTLA4 to the membrane when the response needs to be controlled. PAG (Phosphoprotein Associated with Glycosphingolipid Microdomains), a transmembrane adaptor molecule is associated with CSK (c-Src Tyrosine Kinase), an inhibitor of Src-related protein tyrosine kinases. Overexpression of PAG inhibits TCR-mediated responses.  Dual specificity phosphatase 3 (DUSP3) or VHR is also induced by ZAP70 which consequently down regulates ERK activation and thus controls T-cell response.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tcr_pathway.html) database."

Changes in the SOCS3/STAT3 signaling pathway affect MYC. As SOCS3 has an anti-apoptotic function and MYC an apoptotic function, SOCS3 is considered an important regulator of involution [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17377501)."

    "pathwayTitle": "Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)",
    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP3391",
    "pathwayDescription": "The culture medium of senescent cells in enriched in secreted proteins when compared with the culture medium of quiescent i.e. presenescent cells and these secreted proteins constitute the so-called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), also known as the senescence messaging secretome (SMS). SASP components include inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines (e.g. IL6 and IL8), growth factors (e.g. IGFBPs), shed cell surface molecules (e.g. TNF receptors) and survival factors. While the SASP exhibits a wide ranging profile, it is not significantly affected by the type of senescence trigger (oncogenic signalling, oxidative stress or DNA damage) or the cell type (epithelial vs. mesenchymal) (Coppe et al. 2008). However, as both oxidative stress and oncogenic signaling induce DNA damage, the persistent DNA damage may be a deciding SASP initiator (Rodier et al. 2009). SASP components function in an autocrine manner, reinforcing the senescent phenotype (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008), and in the paracrine manner, where they may promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignancy in the nearby premalignant or malignant cells (Coppe et al. 2008). Interleukin-1-alpha (IL1A), a minor SASP component whose transcription is stimulated by the AP-1 (FOS:JUN) complex (Bailly et al. 1996), can cause paracrine senescence through IL1 and inflammasome signaling (Acosta et al. 2013).<p>Here, transcriptional regulatory processes that mediate the SASP are annotated. DNA damage triggers ATM-mediated activation of TP53, resulting in the increased level of CDKN1A (p21). CDKN1A-mediated inhibition of CDK2 prevents phosphorylation and inactivation of the Cdh1:APC/C complex, allowing it to ubiquitinate and target for degradation EHMT1 and EHMT2 histone methyltransferases. As EHMT1 and EHMT2 methylate and silence the promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes, degradation of these methyltransferases relieves the inhibition of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Takahashi et al. 2012). In addition, oncogenic RAS signaling activates the CEBPB (C/EBP-beta) transcription factor (Nakajima et al. 1993, Lee et al. 2010), which binds promoters of IL6 and IL8 genes and stimulates their transcription (Kuilman et al. 2008, Lee et al. 2010). CEBPB also stimulates the transcription of CDKN2B (p15-INK4B), reinforcing the cell cycle arrest (Kuilman et al. 2008). CEBPB transcription factor has three isoforms, due to three alternative translation start sites. The CEBPB-1 isoform (C/EBP-beta-1) seems to be exclusively involved in growth arrest and senescence, while the CEBPB-2 (C/EBP-beta-2) isoform may promote cellular proliferation (Atwood and Sealy 2010 and 2011). IL6 signaling stimulates the transcription of CEBPB (Niehof et al. 2001), creating a positive feedback loop (Kuilman et al. 2009, Lee et al. 2010). NF-kappa-B transcription factor is also activated in senescence (Chien et al. 2011) through IL1 signaling (Jimi et al. 1996, Hartupee et al. 2008, Orjalo et al. 2009). NF-kappa-B binds IL6 and IL8 promoters and cooperates with CEBPB transcription factor in the induction of IL6 and IL8 transcription (Matsusaka et al. 1993, Acosta et al. 2008). Besides IL6 and IL8, their receptors are also upregulated in senescence (Kuilman et al. 2008, Acosta et al. 2008) and IL6 and IL8 may be master regulators of the SASP.<p>IGFBP7 is also an SASP component that is upregulated in response to oncogenic RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling and oxidative stress, as its transcription is directly stimulated by the AP-1 (JUN:FOS) transcription factor. IGFBP7 negatively regulates RAS-RAF (BRAF)-MAPK signaling and is important for the establishment of senescence in melanocytes (Wajapeyee et al. 2008).<p>Please refer to Young and Narita 2009 for a recent review.\n View original pathway at [Reactome](http://www.reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/#DIAGRAM=2559582)."

The Kelch-like-ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) is a cytoplasmic repressor of NRF2 that inhibits its ability to translocate to the nucleus. These two proteins interact with each other through the double glycine-rich domains of KEAP1 and a hydrophilic region in the NEH2 domain of NRF2. KEAP1 contains many cysteine residues. Phase II enzyme inducers and/or prooxidants can cause oxidation or covalent modification (R) of these cysteine residues. As a result, NRF2 is released from KEAP1. In addition, phosphorylation of NRF2 at serine (S) and threonine (T) residues by kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is assumed to facilitate the dissociation of NRF2 from KEAP1 and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. p38 can both stimulate and inhibit the NRF2 nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, NRF2 associates with small MAF (the term is derived from musculoaponeurotic-fibrosarcoma virus), forming a heterodimer that binds to the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) to stimulate gene expression. NRF2/MAF target genes encode phase II detoxification or antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase alpha2 (GSTA2), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase (gamma -GCLC and gamma -GCLM) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). PI3K also phosphorylates the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta), inducing its translocation to the nucleus and binding to the CCAAT sequence of C/EBP-beta response element within the xenobiotic response element (XRE), in conjunction with NRF2 binding to ARE. Transfection of human neuroblastoma cells with PI3K activates ARE, which is attenuated by a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K or dominant-negative NRF2. Curcumin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) disrupt the NRF2\u2013KEAP1 complex, leading to increased NRF2 binding to ARE. Sulphoraphane directly interacts with KEAP1 by covalent binding to its thiol groups. 6-(Methylsulfinyl)hexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC) \u2014 a sulphoraphane analogue from Japanese horseradish wasabi \u2014 stimulates nuclear translocation of NRF2, which subsequently activates ARE.

That is subsequently filled in by DNA polymerase, which uses the undamaged strand as a template. NER can be divided into two subpathways (blobal genomic NER and transcription coupled NER) that differ only in their recognition of helix-distorting DNA damage.

It is part of the immune system called the innate immune system that is not adaptable and does not change over the course of an individual's lifetime. However, it can be recruited and brought into action by the adaptive immune system. The classical pathway of activation of the complement system is a group of blood proteins that mediate the specific antibody response. [source: Wikipedia]\n\nThe classical pathway begins with circulating C1Q binding to an antigen on the surface of a pathogen, which goes on to active and recruit 2 copies of each C1R and C1S, forming a C1 complex. The activated C1 complex cleaves C2 and C4. Activated cleavage products C2A and C4B combine to form  C3 convertase, which cleaves C3. The cleavage product C3B joins the complex to form C5 convertase, which cleaves C5. The cleavage product C5B joins C6, C7, C8 and multiple copies of C9 to form the membrane attack complex, which forms a channel for water to flood into the target cell, leading to osmotic lysis. The decay accelerating factor (DAF) inhibits C3 convertase.\n\nThe lectin pathway involves mannose-binding lectin (MBL) binding the surface of the pathogen instead of C1Q. MBL-associated serine proteases MASP1 and MASP1 can cleave C2 and C4 in place of the C1 complex, leading to the formation of C3 convertase and the subsequent cascade.\n\nThe alternative pathway relies on the spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 and the cleavage of factor B (CFB) by factor D (CFD), which form an alternative C3 convertase stabilized by factor P (CFP). Additional copies of the cleavage product C3B are recruited to the complex, resulting in an alternative C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 and contributes C5B to the formation of the membrane attack complex.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP545)"

BDNF-TrkB signaling, TrkB being the receptor of BDNF, is involved in transcription, translation, and trafficking of proteins in the various stages of synaptic development and evidence indicates that it also plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time. Synaptic plasticity has been associated with learning and memory development. These functions are carried out through three pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase CG (PLC/PLCG), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Pi3K and MAPK have crucial roles in the protein translation and transport caused by synaptic activity. PLCG regulates intracellular levels of Ca\u00b2\u207a, which drives gene transcription through cyclic AMP. Evidence strongly indicates that abnormal levels of BDNF leads to significant developmental and neurodegenerative diseases by disrupting neural development and function.

CAMKK2 is activated once calmodulin (CALM1) binds with CAAMKK2. The most well-characterized substrates of CaMKK2 are CaMKI, CaMKIV and AMPK\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b1. CaMKK2 phosphorylates CaMKIV, CaMKI and AMPK\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b1 on activation loop Thr residues (Thr-200, Thr-177 and Thr-172, respectively), which increases their kinase activities (PMID:9822657).

It is characterized by signs of presinusoidal portal hypertension without cirrhosis, where the cause of the hypertension is unknown (Lee et al., 2016; Schouten et al., 2011). Based on that what is known about the etiology of PSVD, its development can be categorized into five groups: immunological disorders, chronic infections, exposure to medications or toxins, prothrombic conditions, and genetic predisposition (Schouten et al., 2015). In practice, the disease has multiple contributing factors (Siramolpiwat et al., 2016). \n\nThis pathway describes a mutation in the KCNN3 gene that is hypothesized to result in genetic predisposition to PSVD (Koot et al., 2016). PSVD has also been referred as idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH), hepatoportal sclerosis, incomplete septal cirrhosis, obliterative portal venopathy, partial nodular transformation, non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), and idiopathic portal hypertension (Schouten et al., 2015; Siramolpiwat et al., 2016; Besmond et al., 2017)."

Vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a peptide hormone produced in neurons of the hypothalamus in response to changes in response to extracellular fluid hypertonicity (hyperosmolality), and is secreted into the circulation. When it reaches the kidney, it binds to Vasopressin 2 receptors, triggering an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately leads to aquaporin 2 (AQP2) vesicles inserted in the apical membrane. This increases the water permeability of the membrane. An osmotic gradient then drives water transport from the collecting duct through AQP2, and water exits the cell on the basolateral side, and back into the circulation.\n\nThis description was adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin) and [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/entry/pathway+map04962).\n\nThis pathway was modeled from [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/entry/pathway+map04962)."

    "pathwayTitle": "Prostaglandin and leukotriene metabolism in senescence ",
    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP5122",
    "pathwayDescription": "Prostaglandins are active lipid molecules that are shown to have a great impact on cellular senescence (Wiley et al., 2021). Prostaglandins are derived from arachidonic acid, which is cleaved by the enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) from the membrane phospholipids (Yang et al., 2011). \n\nThe cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway takes part in the induction, as well as the maintenance of senescence. COX-2 is the inducing enzyme which causes the conversion of AA into PGH2 and PGG2, which are then readily converted into PGF2\u237a, PGD2, PGE2, PGI2, and TxA2 through prostaglandin synthases (Cormenier et al., 2017; Martien et al., 2013). The produced active prostaglandins can then act on intracellular receptors and trigger a downward signalling cascade, leading to the stimulation or inhibition of cAMP or the stimulation of Ca\u00b2\u207a. The cAMP-dependent pathway leads to the stimulation of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) production, which then also activates p53. P53 activation reinforces senescence by stimulating the expression of COX mRNA, thus creating a positive feedback loop (Yang et al., 2011).\n\nTwo important active prostaglandins, namely dihomo-15d-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 are highly elevated in senescent cells and induce COX-1 and 2, PTGES and PTGDS production through the activation of RAS and subsequently p53, reinforcing the positive feedback loop. Dihomo-15d-PGJ2 is the most highly elevated senescence-associated prostaglandin and is produced by the elongation of arachidonic acid into adrenic acid, which is then enzymatically converted to yield the prostaglandin. 15d-PGJ2 on the other hand is produced through the dehydration of the active prostaglandin PGD2. In addition, RAS stimulates the secretion of SASP factors, which can consequently affect surrounding cells (Wiley et al., 2021).\n\nLeukotrienes play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Just like prostaglandins, leukotrienes are synthesized from arachidonic acid that was cleaved from the membrane phospholipids (Wiley et al., 2019). ALOX12, ALOX15, ALOX5AP, LTC4S, LTA4H, ALOX15B and ALOX5, which are enzymes that conversion of arachidonic acid to either leukotriene A4 (LT4A) or Arachidonic acid 5-hydroperoxide (5-HPETE), are upregulated in senescence (Wiley et al., 2019; H\u00e4fner et al., 2019). The produced LTA4 can be converted into LTB4 or LTC4. LTC4 can then be consecutively cleaved into LTD4 and LTE4 (Suryadevara et al., 2020). All the mentioned leukotrienes are increased in cellular senescence and are thought to be part of the SASP (Lin & Xu, 2020).\n\nLTD4 is of particular importance in cellular senescence due to its increased interaction with the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) (Wei et al., 2018; Song et al., 2019). This interaction has various consequences, such as the release of intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a, an increase of p21 and it also inhibits sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). SIRT1 regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p53 and the release of various cytokines (Wei et al., 2018).  Therefore, it increases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce cellular senescence via the activation of p53 (Song et al., 2019).\n\nALOX5 contributes to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Catalano et al., 2005; Menna et al., 2010). These ROS are thought to activate p53 which binds to ALOX5 and further increases its action (H\u00e4fner et al., 2019). Moreover, ALOX5 uses Ca\u00b2\u207a as a cofactor and its increased intracellular concentration further promotes ALOX5's action (Menna et al., 2010). LTB4 is also stimulates the production of ROS. ALOX5 then stimulates the phosphorylation of p53 and activates p21 (Menna et al., 2010; Catalano et al., 2005). This then causes the dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB1). As a consequence, senescence is induced (Catalano et al., 2005).\n"

In addition to participating in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions also contain signaling molecules, such as protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent on the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins and the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events.

    "pathwayDescription": "In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase, and therefore the initiation of transcription, requires the presence of a core promoter sequence in the DNA. RNA polymerase is able to bind to core promoters in the presence of various specific transcription factors. The most common type of core promoter in eukaryotes is a short DNA sequence known as a TATA box. The TATA box, as a core promoter, is the binding site for a transcription factor known as TATA binding protein (TBP), which is itself a subunit of another transcription factor, called Transcription Factor II D (TFIID). After TFIID binds to the TATA box via the TBP, five more transcription factors and RNA polymerase combine around the TATA box in a series of stages to form a preinitiation complex. One transcription factor, DNA helicase, has helicase activity and so is involved in the separating of opposing strands of double-stranded DNA to provide access to a single-stranded DNA template. However, only a low, or basal, rate of transcription is driven by the preinitiation complex alone. Other proteins known as activators and repressors, along with any associated coactivators or corepressors, are responsible for modulating transcription rate.

This model of pulmonary DC and macrophage subset differentiation in mice summarizes recent findings suggesting early lineage commitment of cDCs in the BM and differentiation of monocytes into different population with DC, macrophage, or suppressive functions. All DC subsets present in the lung originate from hematopoietic progenitors (HSC) that differentiate into a common myeloid progenitor (CMP). Such CMPs further differentiate to a common DC progenitors (CDPs) or macrophage DC progenitors (MDPs). MDPs give rise to a common monocyte precursor (cMoP). In a CSF-1-dependent mechanism, Ly6Chi monocytes develop, which can further differentiate into Ly6Clo monocytes. Such Ly6Clo monocytes may also derive directly from cMoPs. Both monocyte populations can enter the lung and become monocyte-derived DCs, macrophages, or suppressor cells (25, 62). CDPs also serve as precursors for pDCs and pre-cDCs. Recent studies suggest that the two cDC populations deriving from the pre-cDC progenitor, i.e., CD103+ cDCs and CD11b+ cDCs, arise already in the bone marrow as pre-cDC1/cDC2 subtypes. One study suggested that pulmonary monocytes may differentiate into pulmonary CD103+ and CD11b+ DC; however, it is unclear whether such cells are phenotypically and functionally identical to CD103+ and CD11b+ cDCs. Activation of defined transcription factors (in blue) at distinct time points is critical for lineage commitment of the different DC precursors. During the early developmental stages, important transcription factors include STAT3, IRF8, and PU.1. At later stages, E2-2 is decisive for pDC commitment of CDPs. BATF3 and IRF8 are associated with the CD103+ cDC and IRF4 with the CD11b+ differentiation. In addition to the transcription factors, several growth factors (in green) play key functions in the development of pre-cDCs and the different DC subsets, in particular Flt3L, CSF-1 (M-CSF), and CSF-2 (GM-CSF). The lung contains two major macrophage populations, i.e., alveolar and interstitial macrophages (AMs and IMs, respectively). It is now well appreciated that AMs derive from yolk sac and fetal liver progenitors that colonize the embryonic lung and are maintained by self-renewal at steady state. The origin of IMs remains elusive. Some data suggest that they represent monocyte-derived macrophages.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3892)"

    "pathwayDescription": "Fructose is converted into fructose-1-phosphate, this reaction is facilitated by fructokinase (also called ketohexokinase)(encoded by KHK). Connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease \"essential fructosuria\" which causes a deficiency in fructokinase. After this fructose-1-phosphate is converted into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate, this is facilitated by aldolase B (encoded by ALDOB). connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease \"hereditary fructose intolerance\", which is the result of the absence of aldolase B. The glyceraldehyde produced from this reaction will be converted into D-glycerate through the activity of Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1 or ALDH1A1 (encoded by the ALDH1A1 gene). The D-glycerate will be converted (according to the book) into 2-Phosphoglyceric acid through the activity of Glycerate kinase (encoded by GLYCTK), connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease \"glycerate kinase deficiency\" which results in the accumulation of D-glycerate. The resulting 2-phosphoglyceric acid then goes through a series of reactions resulting in pyruvate.\n\nAnother entry into this pathway is through the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate through glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (encoded by GPI). The fructose-6-phosphate can be converted into fructose-1,6-biphosphate through phosphofructokinase (encoded by PFKL). Fructose-1,6-biphosphate can be converted into fructose-6-phosphate by fructose-1,6-biphosphatase, connected to this reaction is the metabolic disease \"Fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency\". When going further, the fructose-1,6-biphosphate is converted into dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through the activity of aldolase B, this reaction is also affected by hereditary fructose intolerance. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is then eventually turned into pyruvate through a series of reactions. The dihydroxyacetone-phosphate resulting from the aldolase B involved reactions can be converted into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through the activity of triose-phosphate isomerase (encoded by TPI1).\nThis pathway is based on the fructose metabolism pathway (Chapter 18, Figure 18.5) in the book Physicians Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (ed. 4) by Nenad Blau, Marinus Duran, K Michael Gibson, Carlo Dionisi.(ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361))"

It is now known to target multiple cell types. It plays an important role in the expansion and recruitment of mast cells in response to intestinal nematode infection or during autoimmune encephalomyelitis. It is also known to act on various cell types known to be involved in asthma including T cells, B cells, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. IL-9 can promote the expression of TGF-beta in lipopolysaccharide-induced monocytes and macrophages. IL-9 is also known to play important roles in conditions including airway inflammation, EAE and parasitic infections. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated transiently by IL-9, which in turn leads to the growth stimulation of hematopoietic cell lines. IL-9 signals through the heterodimeric receptor composed of a specific chain (IL-9R) and a gamma chain (IL2RG), which is shared between IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL15 and IL-21. The IL-9R and IL-2RG associates with JAK1 and JAK3 respectively. Receptor engagement results in JAK1- JAK3 cross phosphorylation and activation of the JAK proteins which leads to the activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT-1, STAT-3 and STAT-5) and Insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2)/PI3K cascades. IL-9 stimulation also results in the activation of MEK/ERK signaling cascade.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_9_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

    "pathwayDescription": "IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with important role in immune regulation, hematopoiesis, inflammation and oncogenesis. IL-6-type cytokines exert their action via the signal transducer gp130 that associates with IL6R in a cooperative manner to form a hexameric signal transducing complex, capable of activating the down stream mediators of this signaling pathway. This mechanism of signal transduction is shared by other members of the IL-6 type cytokines like IL-11, leukaemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and cardiotrophin-1 that use gp130 as a common subunit of the signal transducing complex. IL-6 stimulation leads to the activation of JAK/STAT pathway. Both STAT1 and STAT3 are phosphorylated and are able to form homo- and heterodimers after activation leading to their nuclear localization and subsequent regulation of transcription of respective target genes. SHP-2 is one of the ubiquitous tyrosine phosphatases and IL-6 stimulation leads to the SHP2-dependent activation of MAPKs, it also links the Grb2-SOS complex and Gab1 to gp130. Phosphorylated Gab1 acts as an adapter and is involved in the indirect association of SHP-2 and PI-3 kinase. Downstream activation of Vav1, Rac-1 and MAP2K4 is necessary for the IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation to accomplish its effects. STAT3 is also phosphorylated by PKCD and it causes inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. PTPN11 and SOCS3 exert inhibitory function and thus lead to down regulation of the signaling cascade.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_6_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

    "pathwayDescription": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene and the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Patients with FXS show a range of typical physical features such as macro-orchidism in males, a long and narrow face, large and protruding ears, and hyperextensible joints. Common comorbidities of FXS are neuropsychiatric disorders such as hyperactivity, depression and anxiety. \nThe mutation of FMR1 in FXS disrupts production of the FMR1 gene product, the fragile mental retardation protein (FMRP). The main function of FMRP is to locally act as a translational repressor for target mRNAs and thereby regulate de novo protein synthesis and ultimately synaptic plasticity. FMRP, together with the mTOR pathway and the ERK pathway regulates expression of target mRNAsn mediated by stimulation of Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) and thereby regulate  \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) internalisation and thus long term depression (LTD).  LTD is a form of synaptic plasticity which is involved in learning and memory. Lack of FMRP leads to exaggerated mGluR dependant LTD, which accounts for most of FXS pathogenesis. "

    "pathwayDescription": "The principal pathways for the metabolism of codeine occur in the liver, although some metabolism occurs in the intestine and brain. Approximately 50-70% of codeine is converted to codeine-6-glucuronide by UGT2B7. Codeine-6-glucuronide has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu-opioid receptor, coded for by the OPRM1 gene. Approximately 10-15% of codeine is N-demethylated to norcodeine by CYP3A4. Norcodeine also has a similar affinity to codeine for the mu-opioid receptor. Between 0-15% of codeine is O-demethylated to morphine, the most active metabolite, which has a 200 fold greater affinity for the mu-opioid receptor compared to codeine. This metabolic reaction is performed by CYP2D6.\n\nApproximately 60% of morphine is glucuronidated to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) while 5-10% is glucuronidated to morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). These reactions are principally catalyzed by UGT2B7 in the liver. UGT1A1 may have a minor role in the formation of M3G, and UGT1A1 and UGT1A8 are capable of catalyzing the formation of M6G in vitro and so contribute to this pathway, although UGT1A8 is minimally expressed in the liver and so is not depicted here. M6G has a higher affinity for OPRM1 than morphine and M3G and so the ratio of morphine to M6G is considered an important indicator of analgesic effect.\n\nTransporters are also depicted in this pathway, as they influence the clearance of codeine, morphine, and their metabolites. Some of the evidence for the involvement of these transporters was derived from experiments done in mice and may or may not be translatable to human pharmacokinetics. The transporters present at the blood-brain barrier, not depicted in this pathway, as well as metabolic enzymes and transporters in the brain and GI tract, likely also play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of codeine and morphine.\n\nA disease linked to this pathway is Gilbert syndrome (visualised in pink), which is characterized by impaired glucuronidation due to a polymorphism in the gene encoding UGT1A1."

Expression of FGFR3 is enhanced by thyroid hormone (T3/3,3',5'-Triiodothyronine) and suppressed by PTHLH (member of the parathyroid hormone family). FGFR3 signaling results in increased expression of Snail1 (encoded by SNAI1), which is required for activation of STAT1 and MAPK signaling (ERK1/2 and p38 branches). Signaling from PTHLH, IHH and BMPs antagonizes the suppression of chondrocyte proliferation by FGFR3.

    "pathwayDescription": "RANKL (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand), RANK (Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B) and the natural decoy receptor of RANKL, OPG (Osteoprotegerin) are three important molecules identified to play a major role in osteoclastogenesis and bone remodelling. They are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. OPG was the first molecule to be discovered and proved to inhibit osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Unlike other members of TNF family, OPG lack a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein by the cell. RANKL is the only known physiological agonist for its receptor, RANK. Genetic experiments have shown that mice lacking either rankl or rank suffer from severe osteoporosis and defective tooth eruption due to complete lack of osteoclasts. On the contrary, mice deficient of OPG shows osteoporosis due to increased number of osteoclasts. Binding of RANKL to RANK triggers downstream signaling events that leads to the activation of osteoclasts and controlling of lineage commitment. RANKL/RANK signaling is essential for skeletal homoeostasis and its interference leads to inhibition of bone resorption resulting in bone diseases including osteoporosis osteopetrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. RANK being a member of TNF family does not possess any kinase activity. It recruits adaptor molecules to transduce the signal after ligand binding. These adaptor molecules are called TNFR-associated factors or TRAF's that binds to different regions in the cytoplasmic tail of the TNF family receptors and transduces the signal downstream. TRAF6 is the main adaptor molecule which activates NF-\u03baB pathway downstream of RANKL signaling which is required for osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation. TRAF6 mutant mice have shown a partial block in osteoclastogenesis and defective activation of mature osteoclasts. Mice lacking NF-\u03baB p50 and p52 proteins have been shown to be osteopetrotic. Catalytic subunits, I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 and I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 and the non-catalytic subunit IKK\u03b3 (also called NEMO) are also essential for RANKL-RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis. IKK\u03b3 is required for osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL in mice both in vivo and in vitro whereas IKK\u03b1 was shown to be required in mice only in in vitro. Several mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK's) have been shown to be activated downstream of RANK. Studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK's blocked RANKL induced osteoclast differentiation. JNK1/2, its upstream kinase MKK7 and c-Jun have also been shown by genetic experiments to be essential for RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis. MAPK1 and MAPK3 phosphorylation was also shown to be dispensable for RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation in vitro, but another report also show that specific inhibitors to MEK increased RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis suggesting a cross talk between p38 and ERK signaling pathways. NFATc1 is an essential downstream target of RANK. Ca2+ oscillations induced by RANKL activated NFATc1 resulting in terminal differentiation of osteoclasts through the Ca2+- dependent calcineurin pathway. NFATc1 translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with other transcription factors leading to the activation of transcription of genes including ACP5, CTSK, TNFRSF11A and NFATc1 under RANKL stimulation. TRAF6 and c-Src interacts with each other and with RANK upon stimulation with RANKL. This interaction increases the kinase activity of c-Src leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as c-Cbl and activation of Akt/PKB which in turn requires the PI3-Kinase activity. Genetic experiments have shown that c-Src is very important in osteoclastogenesis. In addition to these pathways, aPKC/p62 signaling is also reported to be essential for osteoclastogenesis. Apart from their role in osteoclast differentiation and function, RANKL-RANK signaling is also required for development of lymph node and lactating mammary glands in mice and in the establishment of thymic microenvironment.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/rankl_pathway.html) database.\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper: Raju, R., Balakrishnan, L., Nanjappa, V., Bhattacharjee, M., Getnet, D., Muthusamy, B., Thomas, J.

We hypothesize that VDR-bound 1,25(OH)2D3 activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway via either forming a complex and phosphorylating the regulatory subunit of PI3K, or by other unknown mechanisms. This releases and activates the catalytic subunit, which unleashes the PI3K downstream pathway. Among other functions, activation of this pathway promotes the expression of different key glycolytic enzymes, which induces glycolysis. Control of surface marker expression and cytokine production by 1,25(OH)2D3 might arise from its impact on the PI3K pathway, which can control essential transcription factors (e.g., GSK-3\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 and NF-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00baB nuclear translocation) or from the direct regulation of transcription factors, key metabolic bifunctional enzymes, and RNA binding proteins. In the absence of glucose or glycolysis, an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio will be sensed by AMPK, which, in turn, phosphorylates TSC2 and blocks activation of the mTOR complex and its downstream processes. We further consider that the increase in OXPHOS also seen in 1,25D3-DCs is derived from the excess pyruvate generated during induced glycolysis, in addition to the control of metabolic enzymes from the oxidative branch by 1,25(OH)2D3\".\n\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4141)."

NER can be divided into two subpathways (Global genomic NER and Transcription coupled NER) that differ only in their recognition of helix-distorting DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair has more complexity in eukaryotes. \n\nNucleotide excision repair (NER) is a particularly important DNA repair mechanism as evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins including Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome.\n\nThis pathway was adapted from [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+hsa03420), [REPAIRtoire](http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/2/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide_excision_repair).

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP4786",
    "pathwayDescription": "Type I collagen \u2014 the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in bone, skin and tendon \u2014 is mainly secreted by osteoblasts, dermal fibroblasts and tenocytes. Despite the relatively simple structure of the collagen triple helix, the biosynthesis of type I procollagen is extremely complex, involving multiple steps and requiring an ensemble of proteins for post-translational modifications, folding, transport, secretion and quality control. The COL1A1 and COL1A2 transcripts are translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), and the \u03b1(I)\u2011chains undergo a series of post-translational modifications. Helical prolines in position Y of the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat are hydroxylated in position C4 by prolyl 4\u2011hydroxylase 1 (P4H1), whereas specific prolines in the X positions are 3\u2011hydroxylated by P3H1 and P3H2. Some lysine residues are hydroxylated by lysyl hydroxylases (LH1 and LH2, encoded by PLOD1 and PLOD2 respectively), and glycosylation of hydroxylysines into galactosyl-hydroxylysine and glucosyl-galactosyl-hydroxylysine is catalysed by procollagen galactosyltransferase 1 and procollagen glucosyltransferase 1. After synthesis of the carboxy-terminal propeptide, it forms intra-chain disulfide bonds and remains attached to the rER membrane. Selection and association of the correct chains into a triple helix occur by diffusion of the C-propeptides attached to the rER membrane. A nucleus for triple helix formation is formed that staggers the chains in the correct order and initiates triple helix formation. Protein disulfide isomerase catalyses inter-chain disulfide bond formation, which stabilize the folding nucleus. Hydroxylation of proline residues and some lysine residues continues and triple helix formation proceeds from the C-terminal end towards the amino-terminal end. During this phase, 65 kDa FK506\u2011binding protein (FKBP65; encoded by FKBP10) and a complex formed by P3H1 \u2014 CRTAP\u2013 PPIase B (peptidyl-prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerase B) \u2014 seem to play a crucial part. The complex is involved in the Hydroxylation of proline 986 of the collagen \u03b11(I)-chain and \u03b11(II)-chain and proline 707 of the \u03b12(I)-chain, which are thought to be important for supramolecular assembly of collagen fibrils and to serve as binding sites for chaperones or small leucine-rich proteoglycans. Beyond its prolyl 3\u2011hydroxylase activity, the complex functions as a PPIase and chaperone for collagen folding. Indeed, the fast propagation of the triple helix requires the isomerization of cis peptide bonds that convert proline residues into trans configuration, mainly by PPIase B24. When most of the helix is folded, the N-propeptides associate and form the small triple helix within this domain. The newly formed triple helix is stabilized by serpin H1 (also known as HSP47; encoded by SERPINH1) and FKBP65. Further modifications occur during transport from the rER to the Golgi apparatus in special coat protein complex vesicles that contain melanoma inhibitory activity protein 3 (also known as TANGO1, encoded by MIA) and through the Golgi stack by cisternal maturation. Serpin H1 also has binding sites along the helical portion of the molecule and assists shuttling of folded collagen into the cis-Golgi. These biosynthetic steps depend on a proper rER environment (for example, optimal calcium levels and redox potential), and the quality-control mechanisms can lead to the activation of the unfolded protein response using the ER-associated degradation pathway or the autophagy-mediated lysosomal degradation system to eliminate molecules that were not properly folded. Once secreted, the propeptides of procollagen are cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 2 (ADAMTS2) and bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) into mature type I collagen. This initiates collagen fibre formation and these fibrils are stabilized by crosslink formation, in which certain lysine and hydroxylysine residues in the triple helix and the  telopeptides are oxidized by lysyl oxidases and converted into allysine and hydroxyallysine. These residues then initially form divalent crosslinks that convert into mature trivalent pyridinoline and pyrrole crosslinks to stabilize the fibril structure in tissues.\n\nBone formation consists of the secretion of bone extracellular matrix components (mainly type I collagen) by osteoblasts. The unmineralized bone matrix (osteoid) subsequently becomes mineralized. In addition, osteoblasts and osteocytes release many cytokines, including receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) and osteoprotegerin (OPG, encoded by TNFRSF11B), which regulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. RANKL acts on osteoclast precursor cells by binding to receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (RANK; also known as TNFRSF11A) on their surface, thereby favouring their differentiation to osteoclasts. OPG, by interacting with RANKL, prevents the binding of RANKL to RANK. Some osteoblasts become embedded in the mineralized bone matrix and differentiate to osteocytes, which produce, among other factors, sclerostin, an inhibitor of the WNT pathway that is known to stimulate bone formation by stimulating osteoblast activity.\n\nLinked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene.\n\nAdapted from [5]"

Within 24 hours, chemoattractants  and cytokines released from the site of injury activate neutrophils which further recruit B and T cells or recruit monocytes that ultimately result in infiltration and activation by microglia and macrophages. These immune responses result in inflammation, excitotoxicity, cell death, formation of glial scar, and suppression of axonal regeneration.

Inhibiting DDX1 promotes ovarian tumor growth and metastasis in a syngeneic mouse model. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that low DDX1 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with serous ovarian cancer.

There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.\n\nSource: [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa04310.html).

Patients with XLH have elevated levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which is thought to mediate many of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Elevated FGF23 levels have also been observed in other hypophosphatemic disorders, yet the role of FGF23 in the pathophysiology of these disorders is incompletely understood.

Lack of expression of TMPRSS2 may explain age differences in COVID19 severity. In this mechanism, to enter the virus needs to be primed by the host protease TMPRSS2 that splits the Spike protein into 2 peptides S1 and S2. S1 contains the ACE2 receptor binding site, S2 binds to the host cell membrane which leads to membrane fusion, the start of the uptake process.

    "pathwayDescription": "The Wnt/B-catenin pathway begins with Wnt family activation by MBOAT that allows Wnt proteins to translocate out of a cell and bind to FZD and LRP to form a complex. This complex stimulates B-catenin to bind to the TF/LEF complex to regulate gene expression in the cell. Regulation of this pathway takes place at different levels. The Wnt signaling can be inhibited by DKK3, FZD7, SFRP4, FZD8, V3Nter, and Wnt antibodies or FZD antibodies that inhibit FZD and do not allow formation of FZD/LRP/Wnt complex. Another level of regulation is the destruction complex (TNKS/AXIN/GSK3B/APC/CK1a/CK1e) that is regulated by XAV939, DVL, IC261, and Pyrvinium to catalyze the breakdown of B-catenin, inhibiting its binding to the TCF/LEF complex. Several substances including retinoids, glucocorticoids, and ICG-001 inhibit the TCF/LEF complex to stop Wnt/B-catenin signaling pathways from promoting gene transcription. This pathway is based on figure 4 from White et al.\n\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3664)."

It can lead to lupus nephritis, where the kidneys become inflamed.  This causes impaired kidney function and, in severe cases, kidney failure.  Lupus has an incidence of around 5 per 100,000 person-years, and affects women much more frequently than men.\n\nThe development of lupus nephritis involves a complex interplay among B cells, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and other immune components. Key pathogenic mechanisms include:\n\n1.  Overactive B cells produce excessive autoantibodies, leading to the formation of immune complexes that deposit in the kidneys. These deposits trigger complement activation and subsequent inflammation.\n\n2.  Autoreactive B cells present self-antigens to T cells, promoting persistent immune dysregulation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\n3.  Dendritic cells display abnormal recognition and presentation of self-antigens, which initiates and sustains autoimmune responses targeting renal tissues.\n\n4.  B cell differentiation into plasma cells is dysregulated, resulting in continuous production of nephritogenic autoantibodies.\n\nUnderstanding these immunopathogenic processes is critical for the development of targeted therapies aimed at preventing or reversing the progression of lupus nephritis.\n\nInspired by [Figure 2 in Su et al.

It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. \nThe dopamine system plays a central role in several significant medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is an age-related disorder characterized by movement disorders such as stiffness of the body, slowing of movement, and trembling of limbs when they are not in use. The main symptoms are caused by the loss of dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra. These dopamine cells are especially vulnerable to damage, and a variety of insults, including encephalitis (as depicted in the book and movie \"Awakenings\"), repeated sports-related concussions, and some forms of chemical poisoning such as MPTP, can lead to substantial cell loss, producing a parkinsonian syndrome that is similar in its main features to Parkinson's disease.\nThe most widely used treatment for parkinsonism is administration of L-DOPA, the metabolic precursor for dopamine. L-DOPA is converted to dopamine in the brain and various parts of the body by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase. L-DOPA is used rather than dopamine itself because, unlike dopamine, it is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.\nDescription source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2436)."

The hallmark of this disease is the selective death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), as seen in some familial ALS (FALS) cases, is unstable, forming aggregates in the motor neuron cytoplasm, axoplasm and mitochondria. Within mitochondria, mutant SOD1 may interfere with the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, affect mitochondrial import by interfering with the translocation machinery (TOM/TIM), and generate toxic free radicals (ROS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced within mitochondria, inhibit the function of EAAT2, the main glial glutamate transporter protein, responsible for most of the reuptake of synaptically released glutamate. Glutamate excess increases intracellular calcium, which enhances oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage. Mutant SOD1 can also trigger oxidative reactions , which can then cause damage through the formation of hydroxyl radicals or via nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins. Nitration may target neurofilament proteins, affecting axonal transport. Collectively, these mechanisms are predicted to disturb cellular homeostasis, ultimately triggering motor neuron death.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2447)."

Nrf2 then translocates into the nucleus and binds to ARE (antioxidant-responsive) genes in order to increase or decrease transcription. A delayed response to external stressors causes phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 (by unknown tyrosine kinases), GSK-3\u03b2 then activates Src kinases, which then translocate to the nucleus. Src kinases phosphorylate Nrf2 (Tyr568) which allows for nuclear export, ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. If insulin receptor signaling is initiated, GSK-3\u03b2 activity is inhibited. Keap1 is also able to regulate Nrf2 activity through sequestration with PGAM5 to the mitochondria. In addition, PI3K also phosphorylates the CEBPB, inducing its translocation to the nucleus where it binds to the CEBPB response element within the xenobiotic response element, in conjunction with NRF2 binding to ARE.\n\nDescription was adapted from Fig 1 in Vomhof-Dekrey et al, and Fig 4 in Surh et al.\nProtein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from [PhosphoSitePlus (R)](https://www.phosphosite.org)."

These syndromes are X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Adams-Oliver syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease and Shwachmann syndrome.\nX-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is caused by mutations in BTK. BTK is involved in signal transduction from virus single stranded RNA recognition by toll like receptors (TLR8 and TLR9) to NFKB1 mediated gene expression as response. \nAdams-Oliver Syndrome can be caused by mutations in RBPJ, ARHGAP31, DOCK6, DLL4, EOGT and NOTCH1.

    "pathwayDescription": "Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and was initially described as an IFN-\u03b3-inducing factor derived from anti-CD3-stimulated T-helper (Th)1 cells. IL-18 plays a significant role in the activation of hematopoietic cell types mediating both Th1 and Th2 responses and is the primary inducer of interferon-\u03b3 in these cells. The biological activity of IL-18 is mediated through its binding to the IL-18 receptor complex and activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), culminating in the production and release of several cytokines, chemokines, and cellular adhesion molecules. In certain cell types, IL-18 also activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/ AKT serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT) signaling modules leading to the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-18-mediated signaling acts as one of the vital components of the immunomodulatory cytokine networks involved in host defense, inflammation, and tissue regeneration. Albeit its biomedical importance, a comprehensive resource of IL-18 mediated signaling pathway is currently lacking. In this study, we report on the development of an integrated pathway map of IL-18/IL-18R signaling. The pathway map was developed through literature mining from published literature based on manual curation guidelines adapted from NetPath and includes information on 16 protein-protein interaction events, 38 enzyme-catalysis events, 12 protein translocation events, 26 activations/inhibition events, transcriptional regulators, 230 gene regulation events and 84 induced protein expression events."

It is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which results in a deficiency or absence of the protein dystrophin, leading to muscle degeneration.\n\nDMD is characterized by abnormal calcium levels resulting from dysfunction in the muscle cell membrane. This leads to the uncontrolled opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) which inhibits ATP synthesis and thus, drives the cell into apoptosis. This influx activates a cascade of harmful events, including increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of proteases that can damage the cell structure of muscle fibers. \nThe lack of the dystrophin protein affects essential components for muscle contraction namely the Disassembled Dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC) which disturbs the normal contraction-relaxation process of the muscle in DMD. Sustained contractions occur due to the high calcium influx causing muscle stiffness and fibrosis, which are known characteristics of DMD. \n\nIndeed, fibrosis is commonly stimulated in dystrophic muscle cells as a result of the upregulation of several pro-fibrotic transcription factors such as SERPINE1, SCX and GL1. Hence, excessive amounts of collagen and fibronectin are produced, enhancing fibrosis. \n\nAll these events cause chronic inflammation in the muscle cell, attracting pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. The chronic inflammation in DMD can further perpetuate muscle degeneration, fibrosis, and impaired muscle function.\n\nAcknowledgments: Bria Jackson, Amaia Alvarez van Schie, Otto R\u00e4m\u00f6, Tuneille Adelaar"

Iodine is captured by a hydrogen peroxide trap procuced by thyroid peroxidase and added to the 3' and 5' postitions of tyrosine. This can either be free tyrosine or a tyrosine residue in thyroglobuline. After the multiple iodination steps this produces T3 and T4. \nThe production of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4),tri-iodothyronine (T3) and reverse T3 (rT3) is dependent on the organification of iodine into thyroglobulin (Tg), the major protein product of the thyroid (2). This involves thyroid peroxidase catalyzed iodination of tyrosine residues in Tg to form mono- and di-iodotyrosines and their subsequent crosslinking to form the iodothyronines T3 and T4.\n\nIodine 131 is an important radioactive fallout product. It was released in the atmosphere after nuclear tests and after nuclear incidents like at Tchernobyl and Fukushima.

In response, these receptors work in concert with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism. Nuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors only happens when a liganda molecule which affects the receptor's behavioris present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor which in turn activates the receptor resulting in up-regulation of gene expression. A unique property of nuclear receptors which differentiate them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. Consequently nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis.\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_receptor)\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP170)"

    "pathwayDescription": "TNF related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a small pleiotropic cytokine of the TNF super family and its gene is located at chromosome 17p13.1. TWEAK has been reported to be expressed in tissues that include heart, brain, kidney and also in mononuclear blood cells. The multiple biological activities of TWEAK include stimulation of cell growth and angiogenesis, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and stimulation of apoptosis. It has been shown to be involved in the induction of cellular proliferation in liver cells, osteoblasts, astrocytes, synoviocytes, kidney cells and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, TWEAK plays a substantial role in cellular differentiation in osteoclasts. TWEAK induces glioma cell survival via imparting resistance to cytotoxic agents. It imparts its downstream signaling events by binding to its receptor, FGF inducible 14 protein (Fn14). Two modes of TWEAK-Fn14 (ligand-receptor) interactions have been proposed (i) the ligand dependent interaction which involves the higher concentration of homotrimeric TWEAK, that binds to low concentration of Fn14 in a heterohexameric complex (ii) ligand-independent interaction when the ligand concentration is lower than the receptor concentration which induces the ligand independent interaction. The receptors homotrimerize to activate the downstream events. The signaling cascades reported under TWEAK-Fn14 interactions are the canonical and noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathways and the MAPK pathway. There has been a report on crosstalk between Wnt and TWEAK pathways. In myoblasts the PI3K-AKT module has been reported to be inhibited under TWEAK stimulus. AKT phosprorylation leads to the activation of GSK3\u03b2 resulting in increase of phospho-GSk3\u03b2 and active \u03b2-catenin1 (CTNNB1) (dephosphorylated) levels. GSK3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin1 remain associated in the cytoplasm, phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 leads to the dissociation of \u03b2-catenin1 (dephosphorylated) resulting in the nuclear translocation of the protein. Despite of reports on TWEAK binding to other receptors including CD163 and DR3 the downstream events following the binding is yet to be established. The data provided by us would foster enormous avenues for further studies on TWEAK associated proteins and the related disorders such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. The data would enable therapeutic studies by selecting the pathological events and the simultaneous production of blocking agents. Despite the minimal amount of data, ours can also be used in the overlay of various high throughput data enabling pathway analysis and can be accessed by any pathway resource to generate a customized pathway.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/tweak_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite Bhattacharjee2012 paper (see below).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2036)."

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP5046",
    "pathwayDescription": "The uppermost part of the pathway includes part of the general NAM salvage pathway in the cytosol as it is relevant to senescence-induced changes to NAD metabolism. In this pathway, NAD levels are maintained through recycling back to NAD from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (Braidy et al., 2019). The conversion from NAM to NMN is catalyzed by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), while the conversion from NMN to NAD is catalyzed by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs). Other sources, such as nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamid riboside (NR), are not shown here as they are not affected by senescence, at least from current research. OIS-specific interactions are highlighted in orange, while MiDAS-specific interactions are highlighted in purple. General interactions for both (or other senescent types) remain a black color.\n\nThe OIS pathway, induced by Ras singalling in this case, results in the upregulation of HMGA1, and stimulation of the NAMPT enzyme (Nacarelli et al., 2019). Resulting increased levels of NMN (the direct metabolite of NAMPT) translate to increased NAD levels, and a high NAD-NADH ratio. This leads to decreased ADP-ATP levels, which causes a decreased phosphorylated AMPK expression (Nacarelli et al., 2019). This interaction causes increased p38 and p65 activation, and increased NF-\u03baB activity. The  NF-\u03baB signalling pathway has been known to play a key role in the promotion of the proinflammatory SASP (Freund et al., 2011). Furthermore, this is correlated with increased expression of interleukins IL1B, IL6 and IL8, all key factors in the proinflammatory wave of the SASP. In addition, Nacarelli et al. (2019) found that the proinflammatory environment created as a result of the increased NAD-NADH ratio leads to acceleration of cancer progression. NAMPT upregulation through HMGA1 also resulted in the expression of senescence markers SA-\u00df-gal, p16 and p21. The resulting phenotype from this high NAD-NADH ratio is a high proinflammatory SASP.  \n\nMalate is another important metabolite in redox reactions and in many senescence types, including OIS and MiDAS. Of interest to NAD metabolism is the malate-aspartate shuttle, where NADH is transferred from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix through malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1) (Lee et al., 2012). In senescence, levels of MDH1 decrease. On the other hand, decreased activity of MDH1 can induce a senescence response. This reduction in MDH1 activity results in a decreased cytosolic NAD-NADH. Lastly, this inhibition may result in loss of cell proliferation due to the requirement of aspartate synthesis in response to inhibition of the electron transport chain (Birsoy et al., 2015).\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence (MiDAS), on the other hand, causes a decrease in the NAD-NADH ratio, which induces three main responses: (1) the inhibition of sirtuins, (2) the activation of AMPK and (3) the inhibition of PARP which blocks the NF-kB pathway. First, low levels of NAD+ decrease sirtuin activity. A decrease in the activity of SIRT3 and  SIRT5, located in the mitochondria, is associated with the activation of cell senescence (Wiley et al., 2016)). Second, a decreased NAD+/NADH ratio activates AMPK and p53, which inhibits the RNA binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) from degrading the mRNAs encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p16INK4a. This increases the activity of the pRB tumor suppressor, resulting in cell proliferation and growth arrest ((Wiley et al., 2016)). Additionally, p53 activation leads to the release of SASPs that lack IL-1-dependent factors but include the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL27 and TNF-\u03b1 (Wiley et al., 2016). The activation of p53 also reduces glycolysis and promotes mitochondrial respiration, by inhibiting phosphoglycercate mutase (PGM) and inducing the expression of synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2). Furthermore, p53 activation inhibits the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by binding to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). Lastly, the low NAD+,NADH ratio inhibits ADP-ribose donor for poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), which consecutively inhibits the NF-kB pathway. A downregulated NF-\u03baB pathway then contributes to the pathogenic processes of various inflammatory diseases as well as the expression of various proinflammatory SASPs (Liu et al., 2017). \n\nAs visible in this pathway, when senescence is induced by either OIS or MiDAS distinguishable effects on NAD metabolism are evident. Not only do these stimuli release distinct SASPs, but they exhibit distinct responses on the NAD-NADH ratio and subsequent related pathways. While MiDAS leads to a decrease in the NAD-NADH ratio, OIS causes an increase in this ratio and the NAD+ levels.\n"

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP363",
    "pathwayDescription": "WNT signal, through the canonical pathway, controls cell fate determination and through the non-canonical pathway controls cell movement and tissue polarity. The name \"wnt\" is a fusion of two terms, wg derived from the Drosophila gene wingless (wg) and int derived from the proto-oncogene integration-1, which is the mammalian homolog of wg. \u00c3\u0178-catenin is the key regulated effector of Wnt, involved in canonical signaling . Free \u00c3\u0178-catenin is bound by a multiprotein \"destruction complex\". The \u00c3\u0178-catenin destruction complex is comprised of \u00c3\u0178-catenin, scaffold proteins (APC, AXIN) and serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate \u00c3\u0178-catenin casein kinase 1 (CSNK1A1, CSNK1D, CSNK1E, CSNK1G1) and GSK3B. The sequential phosphorylation of \u00c3\u0178-catenin by casein kinase 1 and GSK3 is recognised by an SCF-class E3-ubiquitin ligase, which targets it for polyubiquitination and proteosomal destruction. Canonical WNT signals are transduced through a two-part receptor, a seven-transmembrane Frizzled (FZD) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/LRP6) to a \u00c3\u0178-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling cascade. On recruitment of deshevelled (DVL1) to FZD and AXIN to LRP6, \u00c3\u0178-catenin destruction complex disassembles leading to its stabilization and nuclear accumulation. Nuclear \u00c3\u0178-catenin binds to T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors and Legless family docking protein, BCL9. These activate the transcription of Wnt target genes CCND1, MYC. Non-canonical WNT signaling diverges downstream after being transduced through FZD family receptors and co-receptors, ROR2 and RYK. This pathway does not involve \u00c3\u0178-catenin-mediated gene expression. Small G proteins such as RAC1, RHOA and downstream effectors of RAC including JNK are DVL-dependant effector molecules of the non-canonical pathway. These have been implicated in cytoskeletal rearrangement, dendrite growth and control of cell polarity and orientation. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) are Ca2+-dependant effectors of the non-canonical pathway. NLK inhibits canonical pathway by phosphorylation of TCF/LEF family transcription factors. NFAT transcription factor is implicated in convergent extension during early embryogenesis and carcinogenic metastasis.\n  \nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/wnt_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

    "pathwayDescription": "GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. It is synthesized from glutamate by the enzyme L-glutamic acid decarboxylase. The GABA transporter GAT, located in the plasma membrane of nerve terminals and glial cells, plays an important role in the termination of synaptic transmission. GABA enters the cell via GAT and is then converted to gamma hydroxybutarate or succinate, the latter eventually entering the citrate cycle.\n\nThere are three GABA receptors: GABA(A), GABA(B) and GABA(C) receptor. GABA(A) and GABA(C) receptors belong to the family of transmitter-gated ion channels while GABA(B) receptor is a G protein coupled receptor which is activated by baclofen. GABA(A) receptors are hetero-oligomeric Cl\u207b channels that are modulated by barbiturates and benzodiazepines. GABA(A)R-associated protein (GABARAP) is localized in the golgi and plays a role in intracellular GABA (A) receptor transport via its ability to interact with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and gephyrin (GPHN). Surface receptor number is important since it is a determinant of inhibitory synapse strength. It is controlled by removal of receptors from the membrane by interaction with the clathrin adaptor AP2 followed by recruitment into clathrin-coated pits. GABA(A) receptors can then be targeted for proteasomal degradation.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4159)."

During coronavirus infection, viral proteins are produced in large amounts in the ER, exceeding the ER\u2019s protein folding capacity and leading to large amounts of unfolded proteins. This results in ER stress and activation of the UPR through transmembrane sensors PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. Pathways activation occurs when the protein chaperone GRP78 (HSPA5) dissociates from the PERK/IRE1/ATF6 to bind unfolded proteins, which leads to oligomerization, autophosphorylation and activation [DOI: 10.1107/S0907444911006445].\nActivated PERK inactivates eIF2\u03b1 by phosphorylation, leading to a decrease in overall protein synthesis. eIF2\u03b1 can also be phosphorylated by several other kinases (HRI, GCN2, PKR). PKR activation is shown to be suppressed by coronavirus nsp15 and dsRNA-binding activity of MERS-CoV protein 4a. Activated IRE1 (ERN1) has multiple downstream effects. The IRE1 RNase domain is involved in unconventional splicing of XBP1, creating XBP1S which induces expression of protein folding genes. The RNase domain can also break down mRNAs (IRE1-dependent mRNA decay, RIDD), helping to establish ER homeostasis. Finally, the kinase activity of IRE1 also activates a signaling cascade that leads to the JNK pathway, triggering apoptosis. It is thought that the SARS-CoV E protein suppresses activation of the IRE1 pathway and SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis [10.1371/journal.ppat.1002315]. \nActivated ATF6 is translocated to Golgi and cleaved [DOI: 10.1016/s1097-2765(00)00133-7] to release ATF6-p50, a transcription factor that induces the expression of protein chaperone genes as well as CHOP and XBP1.

From here the UMP can either be used in the nucleic acid synthesis (up) or broken down to Beta-alanine or (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate.\nDisorders in the metabolism of pyrimidine are mostly caused by enzyme defects (highlighted in pink, one disease is depicted in orange, since there appears to be no clinical difference between type 2 and 1 of orotic aciduria, therefore researchers believe that type 2 does not exist officially). The clinical presentation of pyrimidine disorders is very diverse, because of the diversity in biological function.

BDNF is also required for processes such as energy metabolism, behavior, mental health, learning, memory, stress, pain and apoptosis. BDNF is implicated in various neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.\n\nBDNF binds to tyrosine kinase receptor known as tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). It also binds with low affinity to p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). BDNF and its receptors are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system.\n\nBDNF signaling is elicited when it dimerizes and binds to TrkB, resulting in the receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation. The activation of the receptor results in its interaction with molecules such as Shp2, Shc and PLC-gamma. These molecules further interact and modify their downstream targets leading to various neuronal processes. BDNF activates the signaling cascades such as PLC/PKC, PI3K/Akt, Ras/Erk, AMPK/ACC and NF\u03baB pathways. BDNF through PLC/PKC pathway leads to release of intracellular calcium and regulation of synaptic plasticity. It also maintains synaptic plasticity through cAMP/PKA signaling. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway through BDNF/TrkB interaction inhibits cell apoptosis by decreasing the expression of BIM. However, BDNF/p75NTR interaction activates JNK through TRAF6, which leads to apoptosis. Activation of JNK3 also leads to proteolytic cleavage of the p75NTR by TACE. PI3K/Akt also leads to activation of mTOR pathway and subsequently protein synthesis. Ras/Erk signaling is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and protection of neurons. BDNF also leads to neuronal survival through Erk5/Mef pathway. Phosphorylation of synapsin by Erk1/2 leads to neurotransmitter release. BDNF signaling leads to nitric oxide production through NF\u03baB pathway. BDNF induces neurite outgrowth through activation of JAK/STAT, Rac, and Cdc42 pathways. BDNF enhances oxidation of fat through AMPK mediated inhibition of ACC. It also plays role in microtubule assembly through inhibition of GSK3-beta. It leads to oxidative neuronal necrosis through activation of NCF molecules. BDNF also regulates the surface expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors. BDNF also regulates the expression of genes leading to processes such as differentiation of dendrites and calcification of cementoblast-like cells.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2380)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a highly pleiotropic, autosomal recessive disease that leads to multisystem defects and has an intricate cellular phenotype, all linked to the functional inactivation of a single gene. Extensive research on the phenotype and the recent discovery and cloning of the responsible gene point to a defect as a central biochemical locus which links several signal transduction pathways that operate under stress as well as in normal physiological conditions.\n\nAtaxia is the first symptom in all patients and is predominantly truncal, first manifested in swaying of the head and trunk on standing and even sitting. Truncal ataxia precedes appendicular cerebellar disease. In the first years of life, certain manifestations are present such as dysarthria, muscular hypotonia, the slow initiation and performance of all voluntary movements, characteristic hypotonic facies and postures, and drooling. Dyssynergia and intention tremor of the upper extremities become a major feature after the fifth year of life. The tendon reflexes are diminished or lost, but may be normal or even hyperactive in the early stages. All these observations show a clear ataxia of cerebellar type, initially of station and gait, and later of intention. Early observations of brains from patients with A-T showed neurodegenerative changes, particularly in the Purkinje and granular cells of the cerebellum. Neuronal degeneration is also present in the brainstem, and dentate and olivary nuclei atrophy. Neuronal loss occurs in the substantial nigra and oculomotor nuclei, dorsal root ganglia, and degenerative changes are evident in spinal motor neurons, and dorsal root and sympathetic motor neurons. Moreover, multiple abnormalities in Purkinje cell development have been observed in an Atm-deficient mouse model. Misplaced Purkinje cells have been observed in both the granular and molecular cell layers. In addition, Purkinje cell dendrites tend to grow laterally instead of extending towards the surface of the cerebellum.\n\nATM (for Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) has been located by restriction-fragment length polymorphism in the chromosome 11, location: 108,093,211-108,239,829. Interestingly, the site of ATM is the same or adjacent to the region occupied by CD3 (Antigen, Delta subunit), THY1 (T-Cell antigen), and NCAM (Cell Adhesion Molecule, Neural, 1) genes, all of which are members of the immunoglobulin-gene superfamily and consequently may be subject to the same defect that afflicts the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin molecules in A-T. The ATM gene presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 9,165 kb cDNA and is constituted by 66 exons spread over 150 kb of genomic DNA which has a transcript of 12 kb. The ORF of this transcript predicts a 370-kDa protein composed of 3056 amino acids. Over 300 mutations have been found in A-T patients, distributed across the full length (150 kb of genomic DNA) of the ATM gene.\n\nSequence homology indicates that the atm gene product falls into a family of proteins that are related to the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). This family includes TEL1, MEC1, TOR1, and TOR2 of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RAD3 of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and MEI-41 of Drosophila melanogaster. The mammalian family member most closely related to ATM is the ATR/FRP1 protein and, like its yeast homologs, it mediates cellular responses to unreplicated or damaged DNA. In humans the PI 3-kinase family includes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and FRAP. These sequence homologies appear to reflect functional homology because many of the PI 3-kinase family members are involved in DNA repair, recombination and cell cycle control. Despite the resemblance to lipid kinases, members of this family, including ATM, possess a serine/threonine protein kinase activity, which is wortmannin sensitive.\n\nATM phosphoprotein is ubiquitously expressed and predominantly found in nuclei of proliferating cells, but subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed that 10-20% of the protein is present in cytoplasmic vesicles, including peroxisomes and endosomes and a prominent cytoplasmic fraction in mouse oocytes. ATM is endosome-bound in mouse neurons, suggesting molecular sorting of the protein occurs in the cytoplasm. In Purkinje cells, distribution of ATM protein is primarily in cytoplasm, and this may be related to the differentiation state of the cells. ATM mRNA is present in all human and mouse tissues. In situ hybridization shows that ATM mRNA is expressed throughout the whole mouse embryo. Furthermore, ATM has been associated with beta-adaptin in lymphoblast vesicles indicating that it may play a role in intracellular vesicle and/or protein transport mechanisms. No obvious nuclear localization signals have been detected in ATM. Neither an ectopically expressed N-terminal fragment of the protein nor a C-terminal fragment is capable of entering the nucleus."

    "pathwayDescription": "Endogenous cannabinoid receptors belong to the endocannabinoid system and are located in the mammalian brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, consisting of neuromodulatory lipids and their receptors. The endocannabinoid system is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory, and in mediating the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Two primary endocannabinoid receptors have been identified: CNR1 and CNR2. CNR1 is found predominantly in the brain and nervous system, as well as in peripheral organs and tissues, and are the main molecular target of the endocannabinoid ligand (binding molecule), Anandamide, as well as its mimetic phytocannabinoid, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). One other main endocannabinoid is 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) which is active at both cannabinoid receptors, along with its own mimetic phytocannabinoid, CBD (cannabidiol). 2-AG and CBD are involved in the regulation of appetite, immune system functions and pain management.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system \n\nNot all MAPK subtypes are relevant for this pathway.

    "pathwayDescription": "Base excision repair is a cellular mechanism that repairs damaged DNA throughout the cell cycle. It is primarily responsible for removing small, non-helix-distorting base lesions from the genome. \nBase excision repair is important for removing damaged bases that could otherwise cause mutations by mispairing, or could lead to breaks in DNA during replication. \n\nBER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove specific damaged or inappropriate bases, forming AP sites. These are then cleaved by an AP endonuclease. The resulting single-strand break can then be processed by either short-patch (where a single nucleotide is replaced) or long-patch BER (where 2-10 new nucleotides are synthesized). The choice between short- and long-patch repair is currently under investigation. Various factors are thought to influence this decision, including the type of lesion, the cell cycle stage, and whether the cell is terminally differentiated or actively dividing. Some lesions, such as oxidized or reduced AP sites, are resistant to pol \u03b2 lyase activity and therefore must be processed by long-patch BER.\n\nThis pathway is based on information from REPAIRtoire (http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/4/), Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair) and KEGG (https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map03410).

    "pathwayDescription": "\"Model for signaling pathways and transcription factors that regulate B cell commitment to the germinal center (GC) fate. Boxes that indicate signaling molecules are colored yellow, transcription regulators red, downstream gene targets turquoise and epigenetic modifiers purple. \n\nThe B cell receptor (BCR), via its signaling subunits Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 as well as downstream tyrosine kinases such as SYK and LYN, activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. MAPK signaling induces the expression of the transcriptional activator myocyte enhancer binding factor 2c (MEF2C), which promotes the transcription of B cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl2l1) and cyclin D2 (Ccnd2). The expression of the transcriptional repressor inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3) is reduced following B cell activation, allowing for transcription factor 3/4 (TCF3/4)-driven induction of Icosl and Mef2b transcription. \n\nPI3K/AKT and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling also induce the expression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). IRF4 and TCF3/4 induce the expression of the co-activator OBF1 (also known as POU class 2 homeobox associating factor 1 (POU2AF1)), which cooperates with OCT2 (also known as POU class 2 homeobox 2 (POU2F2)) to promote transcription of Slamf1, Syk and Il6. OBF1 and OCT2 can also induce the expression of the transcription factor SPI-B, which acts in a redundant fashion with PU.1 to enhance the transcription of genes encoding B cell surface receptors, such as Cd40, B cell activating factor receptor (Baffr), Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) and Tlr9, and many components of the BCR signaling pathway, including Blnk and Btk. \n\nAlthough transiently elevated levels of IRF4 can induce the expression of B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), sustained IRF4 levels will repress BCL-6 expression. BCL-6 expression is also induced by the transcription factors MEF2B and IRF8/PU.1 as well as the cytokines IL-4 and IL-21, which bind to their respective receptors (IL-4R and IL-21R) and induce signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6)/STAT3 signaling. CD40 and/or TLR-driven NF-\u03baB signaling, alongside PI3K/AKT signaling, will induce the expression of the transcription factor MYC, which promotes cellular proliferation by inducing the transcription of Ccnd2/Ccnd3 and the expression of the transcription factor E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1). E2F1 induces expression of Ezh2 that encodes a Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) enzymatic component. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) promotes cell cycle progression by repressing the expression of Cdkn1a, Cdkn2a and Cdkn1b, which encode cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. EZH2 also promotes E2F1 release from the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein via phosphorylation of Rb, thereby enhancing E2F1 activation and further EZH2 expression. BCL-6 can directly repress MYC expression, thereby limiting the number of cell divisions that GC B cells undergo. BCL-6 promotes GC B cell development through regulation of numerous genes controlling cellular processes including the DNA damage response, B cell migration, apoptosis, BCR and CD40 signaling, plasma cell differentiation and T cell:B cell interactions. Together, these transcriptional regulators allow for the precise control of GC initiation that is necessary to balance the competing needs of the immune system to induce a protective response while limiting immunopathology.\"\n\nDerived from https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/figures/PMC7538181__41577_2020_446_Fig1_HTML.html"

One of them leads to the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan (di)sulfate, while the other ends with heparan mono-, bi- or trisulfate. Some of the reactions are catalyzed by unknown enzymes that should be researched in the future.\nThis pathway was created based on the information from the pathways found in MetaCyc and HumanCyc databases (see Bibliography). As some of the metabolites do not have identifiers in databases supported by PathVisio (such as ChEBI or KEGG), their MetaNetX IDs were added in the comments.\n"

    "pathwayDescription": "DNA, namely cytosine, methylation is the key event in epigentics. The degree of methylation influences gene expression and methylation disorders are known to be major causes of some diseases like Rett syndrome and some cancer types. Epigenetic effects also contribute to the development of Alzheimers' disease, developmental retardation by alcohol, Huntington's disease and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Methylation is not a static event but a highly dynamic and therefore highly regulated procedure. Cytosine is methylated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) forming 5-methylcytosine (5mC). In a second step, 5mC is transformed to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven-translocation enzymes (TET1-3). These enzymes are sensitive to regulation by a variety of metabolites (ethanol, a-ketoglutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate), miRNA and MeCP2 (targeting directly TET1). Proteins binding methylated DNA like MeCP2 or Mbd3 (as part of the NURD complex) also inhibit the conversion by blocking the target. MeCP2 also binds on 5hmC and block the transition to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) which is also catalyzed by the TET enzymes. The conversion back to cytosine is done by tymine DNA glycosylase (TGD) and base excision repair mechanism either directly or over another TET catalyzed step forming 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Scheme of mammalian tryptophan catabolism. Briefly, in mammalian cells, tryptophan is used mostly for protein synthesis. In a second quantitatively important pathway (driven by IDO in most cell types and by TDO more specifically in liver cells), it is the starting point of the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway gives birth to several metabolites, providing the appropriate enzymes that metabolize the various kynurenine intermediates are expressed. The main route of the kynurenine pathway leads to the formation of N -formyl kynurenine, L -kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 3-hydroxyanthra- nilic acid, quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and in fine nicotinamine adenine dinucleotides. Additional lateral branches of the kynurenine pathway lead to the formation of other terminal kynurenines, such as KA, xanthurenic acid, and anthranilic acid. Kynurenines indicated in boldface type ( i.e. L -kynurenine and KA) correspond to the most abundant kynurenines found in caput epididymal tissue. Outside the kynurenine pathway, tryptophan is also the precursor of serotonin and melatonin. A very small proportion of tryptophan is also transformed into indol derivatives, such as indoxyl acetic acid. Conversion of Trp to N -formyl kynurenine is achieved via IDO and/or TDO. \n\nThe kynurenine pathway can lead to the intracellular NAD+ production and consumption. De novo synthesis begins with the conversion of tryptophan to quinolate, which is converted to NaMN. NaMN is then adenylylated to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+), which is converted to NAD+. NAD+-consuming enzymes break the bond between the Nam and ADP-ribosyl moieties. Nam, which is also provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN, which is adenylylated to form NAD+. Na, which is provided in the diet and, potentially, by bacterial degradative pathways in vertebrates, is salvaged to form NaMN. NR, which occurs extracellularly in blood and milk and can be provided in the diet, is salvaged to NMN. Na and Nam are also converted to nicotinuric acid and N-methylnicotinamide elimination products."

Saturating one of them yields dihydrofolate (DHF) and adding an additional molecule of hydrogen across the second yields tetrahydrofolate (THF). Folates serve as donors of single carbons in any one of three oxidation states: 5-methyl-THF (CH3THF; reduced), 5,10 methylene-THF (CH2THF; intermediate) and 10-formyl-THF (CHOTHF; oxidized). The single carbon donor CH3THF is used to convert homocysteine into methionine which can then be used to methylate DNA, the donor CH2THF is used (along with a molecule of hydrogen at the site of one of the double bonds) to convert dUMP (deoxyuridylate) into dTMP (thymidylate) and the donor CHOTHF is used to set up ring closure reactions in de novo purine synthesis. CH3THF is the primary methyl-group donor for processes such as DNA methylation reactions. Purines are used both in RNA synthesis and in DNA synthesis and dTMP is synthesized srtictly for DNA synthesis, be it for DNA repair or DNA replication.\nThe folate pathway is central to any study related to DNA methylation, dTMP synthesis or purine synthesis.\n\nDifferential methylation (e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors) as well as disturbances in nucleotide synthesis and repair, are associated with several forms of cancer. There are also indications that hypermethylation is involved in the progression of adenomas to cancer. \n\nThe pathway is also illustrative of the role of a number of B vitamins, including vitamin B12 (cobalamine) which is important for the sythesis of folate (vitamin B9) and of methionine. \n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP241)."

When the energy charge is low, CoA is not acylated, therefore, pyruvate carboxylase is inactive, and pyruvate is preferentially metabolized via the PDHc and the TCA cycle to CO2 and H2O. The acetyl-CoA produced by the PDHc enters the TCA cycle and the reduced electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) that are generated during the oxidative reactions can then be used to drive ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation.\nDescription source: [The Medical Biochemistryp Page](https://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/tca-cycle.php).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2453)."

Since lipids (fats) are hydrophobic, hydrolysis in lipid metabolism occurs in the cytoplasm which ends up creating glycerol and fatty acids. Due to the hydrophobic nature of lipids they require special transport proteins known as lipoproteins, which are hydrophilic. Lipoproteins are categorized by their density levels.

A study published in August 2005 revealed that patients treated with valproic acid in addition to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed a 75% reduction in latent HIV infection. \nSource: description from http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00313\nMetabolic pathway from: http://smpdb.ca/view/SMP00635\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3871)."

The tubulin dimers that constitute MTs (depicted in green) are bound and sequestered by stathmin (STMN1), enhancing MT dynamics by increasing rapid depolymerization (a.k.a., \"MT catastrophe\"). \n\nMT dynamics are also enhanced by collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP2), which increases MT growth by promoting the addition of tubulin dimers onto microtubule plus ends. Other proteins that associate with assembled MTs include those that stabilize MTs (e.g. tau or MAPT), those that promote assembly (e.g., XMAP215), and those that maintain MTs in a dynamic state (e.g., MAP1B). Complexes between the adenomateous polyposis coli (APC) protein and plus end binding proteins (e.g., EB1) stabilize MTs by increasing the duration of the MT elongation phase. MT instability is promoted by several nonmotile kinesins from the kinesin-13 family, e.g., the mitotic centromere associated kinesin, MCAK, by accelerating the transition to catastrophe by weakening the lateral interactions between the protofilaments.\n\nUpstream from these processes, major signaling pathways act to regulate MT dynamics, e.g., those converging on GSK3B, a kinase which targets tau and CRMP2.\n\nReference: https://www.cellsignal.com/contents/science-pathway-research-cytoskeletal/regulation-of-microtubule-dynamics-signaling-pathway/pathways-micro\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2038)"

    "pathwayDescription": "Pyrimidines are nucleic acids and the products of pyrimidine degradation are water-soluble. The pyrimidine ring is synthesized before it is conjugated to PRPP. The first reaction is the conjugation of carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate to make N-carbamoylaspartate. The carbamoyl phosphate synthetase used in pyrimidine biosynthesis is located in the cytoplasm. The enzyme that carries out the reaction is aspartate transcarbamoylase, an enzyme that is closely regulated. The second reaction is ring closure to form dihydroorotic acid by the enzyme dihydroorotase. This circular product contains a 6-membered ring with nitrogen and carbons located in the same positions as in the mature pyrimidine ring. The third reaction is the oxidation of the ring to form a carbon- carbon bond. The reducing equivalents are transferred to a flavin cofactor of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The product is orotic acid. Fourth, the orotate ring is transferred to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form a 5-ribose-phosphate, orotidylic acid. Finally orotidylate is decarboxylated to yield UMP, which of course contains one of the bases of RNA. Cellular kinases convert UMP to UTP. Transfer of an amido nitrogen from glutamine by CTP synthetase converts UTP to CTP; this reaction uses an ATP high-energy phosphate. Pyrimidine synthesis is controlled at the first committed step. ATP stimulates the aspartate transcarbamoylase reaction, while CTP inhibits it. CTP is a feedback inhibitor of the pathway, and ATP is a feed-forward activator. This regulation ensures that a balanced supply of purines and pyrimidines exists for RNA and synthesis.\nEukaryotic organisms contain a multifunctional enzyme with carbamoylphosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and dihydroorotase activities. Two mechanisms control this enzyme. First, control at the level of enzyme synthesis exists; the transcription of the gene for the enzyme is reduced if an excess of pyrimidines is present. Secondly, control exists at the level of feedback inhibition by pyrimidine nucleotides. This enzyme is also an example of the phenomenon of metabolic channeling: aspartate, ammonia, and carbon dioxide enter the enzyme and come out as orotic acid\n\nDescription text is based on [Cliff's Notes](https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/biology/biochemistry-ii/purines-and-pyrimidines/pyrimidine-metabolism).\n\nPathway is based on [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway+map00240).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP4022)."

In addition to Calcium (Ca\u00b2\u207a) and phosphorous (P) absorption, its association with CVD, hypertention, cancer, obesity, diabetes and immune system has been reported. It actively participates in the regulation of cardiovascular system through Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS). Renin is secreted by the kidney and it activates the formation of angiotensin II that leads to the decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) and increased endothelial vascular dysfunction (P\u00e9rez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2016). Vitamin D causes the insulin release, facilitates muscle contraction and glucose uptake by enhancing the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) channels in the cells (Berridge, 2017) and reduces the aldosterone . From last few years vitamin D has gained special attention as immunomodulatory agent. The immunologic cells such as B cells, T cells, and antigen presenting cells express vitamin D receptors on their cells as well as are capable of synthesizing vitamin D metabolites especially calcitriol. The beneficial effects of vitamin D are linked with both innate and adaptive immune systems. During vitamin D deficiency an unwanted production of pro-inflammatory cytokines cause atherosclerotic lesions and atherogenesis. These conditions lead to increased vasoconstriction and decreased vasodilation, endothelial dysfunction, and alleviated nitric oxide formation. Furthermore, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; responsible for the retrospective production of Ang1-7 form Ang II) is also reduced in vitamin D deficient subjects. Such individuals are more vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially, recent pandemic of COVID-19 (Malek Mahdavi, 2020)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6) - type cytokine family. It is mainly produced in activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and microglial cells. OSM signaling is initiated by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I LIFR-gp130 receptor complex, or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor (O\u2019Hara et al). The major downstream signaling pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K pathways (Halfter, Halfter, Stross, Brantley). As the receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) phosphorylate OSM receptor complex and STATs (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) (O\u2019Hara, Fritz, Migita, Hintzen). Phosphorylated STATs form homodimeric complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B) or heterodimeric complex (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate to the nucleus. Once inside nucleus STAT proteins bind to regulatory elements in the promoter of OSM-responsive genes and regulate the gene expression (O\u2019Hara, Halfter, Halfter, Hintzen). Alternatively, OSM induced phosphorylation of PTPN11, GRB2, SHC1, Ras/Raf molecules can bring about the activation of ERK1/2 signaling module (O\u2019Hara). Oncostatin M -through ERK1/2 signaling module induces the phosphorylation of CEBPB, both CEBPB and EGR1 stimulates the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism (Zhang). Although OSM also causes induced phosphorylation in MAPK family members (MAPK8/9/14) the functional importance of this is at present not well understood (O\u2019Hara, Li). OSM mediated signaling cascade is negatively regulated by JAK1 inhibition by SOCS3 and STAT3 inhibition by PIAS3 (Stross, Brantley, Chung). OSM also induces the activation of caspase family members (CASP3, CASP7, CASP9) through the JAK2 module and regulates apoptosis (Auernhammer, Tiffen, Chipoy). In osteosarcoma cells, OSM mediates apoptosis through a less understood STAT5B signaling module (Chipoy). "

Through the Non-SMAD pathway, the activation of MAPK and Pi3k  causes the activation of ERK, AKT and phosphates, and then into the nuclear signalling.

Unattached or mal-orientated chromosomes generate a signal to delay the onset of anaphase until all pairs of sister chromatids are properly aligned on the metaphase plate. This signal is transduced by a relay of spindle-checkpoint proteins, including MAD1, MAD2, BUB1, BUBR1, BUB3 and centrosome protein E (CENPE), which inhibits cell division cycle 20 (CDC20)-mediated activation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Following attachment and alignment of all the chromosomes at metaphase, the checkpoint signal is silenced and APC/C initiates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of securin and activation of separase. Separase in turn cleaves a multiprotein complex termed cohesin, which creates physical links between sister chromatids to initiate anaphase.\nThis process may be of interest in colorectal cancer, specifically in terms of the chromosome instability phenotype, which could result from defects in pathways that ensure accurate chromosome segregation.

    "pathwayDescription": "Prolactin (PRL), a pleiotropic polypeptide hormone, mostly secreted by the lactotrophic cells of anterior pituitary gland and to a lesser extent expressed in numerous extra pituitary tissues such as adipose tissue, lymphocytes, blood, plasma, skin fibroblasts, mammary epithelial cells, spleen, thymus, breast, prostate and sweat glands. Prolactin has been established to be present in all vertebrates and involved in more than 300 different effects, which can be ascribed to six broad categories: (i) reproduction and lactation, (ii) growth and development, (iii) endocrinology and metabolism, (iv) brain and behaviour, (v) immunomodulation and (vi) osmoregulation. Prolactin mediates its multiple functions through prolactin receptor (PRLR), a member of class I cytokine receptor superfamily. The PRLR comprises of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain. PRLR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues such as brain, mammary epithelium, liver, cerebellum and lymphocytes. Prolactin has been shown to be involved in the progression of different forms of cancer such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Clinically, higher levels are found in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Reiter's syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome. Besides 23 kDa full length PRL, a 16-kDa (16K PRL) N terminal fragment of prolactin produced by the cleavage by Cathepsin D has potent antiangiogenic and vasoconstrictive role in endothelial cells. In rat pulmonary fibroblasts cells 16K PRL is found to activate NF-kB pathway. Evidences also suggested that it has definite roles in programmed cell death in endothelial cells by activating various caspases. Prolactin associates with PRLR and induces the dimerization and activation of the receptor. The signaling reactions downstream of the long receptor isoform have been studied well and little is known about prolactin actions facilitated by short isoform. Since PRLR lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, it initiates signal transduction through its associated kinases in the cytoplasmic tail. PRL signaling activate Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3- kinase), Src kinase and serine/threonine kinase Nek3-vav2-Rac1 pathways through the long isoform of the receptor. The prolactin signaling through short isoform can activate different downstream cascades except JAK/STAT pathway. JAK2 phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues of the receptor PRLR and enables the binding of downstream signaling molecules mainly signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. The STATs are considered as major effectors for PRL-dependent cell proliferation and gene activation, with STAT5 serving as the primary mediators. The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimmerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of PRL-induced genes, activating gene transcription. Prolactin signaling also activates MAP kinase pathways and is reported to be involved in proliferation of normal and mammary tumor cells. Prolactin also stimulates PI-3K pathway and is reported that activation of PI-3K/AKT pathway initiates cell survival of lymphoid cells. Upon prolactin stimulation, the adapter protein GAB2 phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue recruits the catalytic subunit of PI-3K. Apart from these, prolactin also regulates cytoskeletal re-organization through the activation of Rac pathway. The Prolactin receptor dependent interactions of serine/threonine kinases NEK3 with guanine nucleotide exchange factors VAV1 and VAV2 and Tec with VAV1 regulate cytoskeleton remodeling.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/NetSlim_56) database.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2037)"

A small proportion of cases, however, can be attributed to known genetic factors. Mutations in specific genes have been conclusively shown to cause PD. These genes code for alpha-synuclein (SNCA), parkin (PRKN), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2 or dardarin), PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), DJ-1 and ATP13A2.[4][22] In most cases, people with these mutations will develop PD. With the exception of LRRK2, however, they account for only a small minority of cases of PD.[4] The most extensively studied PD-related genes are SNCA and LRRK2. Mutations in genes including SNCA, LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have been found to be risk factors for sporadic PD. The role of the SNCA gene is important in PD because the alpha-synuclein protein is the main component of Lewy bodies.[22] Missense mutations of the gene (in which a single nucleotide is changed), and duplications and triplications of the locus containing it have been found in different groups with familial PD. Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common known cause of familial and sporadic PD, accounting for approximately 5% of individuals with a family history of the disease and 3% of sporadic cases.\n\n\nSources: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease), [Qiagen](https://www.qiagen.com/geneglobe/pathwayview.aspx?pathwayID=345), and [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05012.html).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2371)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Androgens, mainly testosterone and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) play significant role in the growth and development of the male reproductive organs. These steroid hormones bring about their biological functions through their associations with Androgen receptor (AR), a 110 KDa ligand dependent transcription factor that falls under the group of nuclear receptor superfamily. DHT binds the receptor with high affinity compared to testosterone. The AR gene is located in the X chromosome at Xq11-12 site. AR is cytosolic protein, which in the ligand unbound state, is present as a complex with various Heat shock proteins primarily Hsp70, 90 and 56 as well as p23. Upon ligand binding, it dissociates from the complex. AR is found to be expressed in a number of tissues and cells including prostate, testis, seminal vesicle, epididymis, skin, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, liver and central nervous system. The protein has four functional domains- an N terminal domain (NTD), a DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region and a Ligand binding Domain (LBD). The DBD is a 658 amino acid residue region that has ZNF motifs which allows it bind to DNA. The rest of the domains are involved in dimerization and ligand binding. Two phosphorylation events are proposed to play very important role in the activation of the receptor upon ligand binding. The first phosphorylation event releases the ligand binding domain for hormone binding. The subsequent phosphorylation event is triggered upon hormone binding. Activated AR upon ligand binding undergoes conformational change to form a homodimer and interacts tightly with the Androgen Response Element (ARE). The androgen receptor is known to bind to many co-regulators at different time points and in different cell types. This DNA protein complex triggers the expression of various target genes that are associated with the male phenotype. Modulation of the AR activity is carried out by several transcription factors like ARA70, TR4, SRC family members and CBP/p300 and other associated proteins. FXXLF and WXXLF motifs containing coactivators such as the p160 members bind with the AF2 region of the Ligand Binding Domain of the AR. Androgen receptors are known to induce apoptosis under certain conditions. Various regulators that regulate androgen induced apoptosis include BRCA1 and Smad3 and Akt. Mutation in AR are also known to be associated in a number of diseases including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) or Kennedy's disease and Androgen Insensitivity syndrome (AIS).

    "pathwayDescription": "Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk for the development of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and kidney cancer. HLRCC is characterized by germline mutation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH). FH-deficient kidney cancer is characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation and a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis, a form of metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect. \n\n\nAMPK is a negative regulator of the Warburg effect in Fumarate hydratase-deficient kidney cancer. Fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient kidney cancer, characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and undergoes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP required for the increased energetic demands of rapidly proliferating cells. The increased glycolysis suppresses expression and activation of AMPK which results in increased S6 and ACC activity, promoting anabolic growth and proliferation. Decreased AMPK results in decreased p53 and the iron transporter, DMT1. The iron responsive proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, as well as the IRP target, transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) are elevated, indicating that cytosolic iron concentrations decrease secondary to decreased DMT1 activity. Prolyl hydroxylase, which is sensitive to iron levels, would be inhibited by decreased cytosolic iron levels, stabilizing HIF1\u03b1. Fumarate, which increases in FH- deficient cells, has been shown to inhibit prolyl hydroxylase, which would lead to further stabilization of HIF1\u03b1, increasing transcription of factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the glucose transporter, GLUT1. Increased fumarate has been shown to succinate KEAP1, thus altering it's conformation and disrupting its ability to induce degradation of Nrf2. Nrf2 transcription is increased activating anti-oxidant response and protecting against oxidative stress. Increased HIF1\u03b1 would stimulate LDHA, increasing lactate production, and would stimulate PDK1, which inhibits PDH and would decrease entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. FH-deficient kidney cancer use a glutamine- dependent reductive carboxylation rather than rather than oxidative metabolism for citrate formation (red arrows). Glutamine is the major source for the increased fatty acid synthesis required for rapid proliferation in these cells with disabled normal oxidative phosphorylation. Potential approaches for treatment of this aggressive form of kidney cancer include agents that stimulate AMPK, agents that target the tumor vasculature and glucose transport, agents that inhibit LDHA and agents that target the critical glutamine-dependent reductive fatty acid/lipid synthetic pathway.

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP4216",
    "pathwayDescription": "CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as  microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).\n\nThis pathway is based on information from [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?map05210).\n\nThe most common mutation in colon cancer is inactivation of APC. When APC does not have an inactivating mutation, frequently there are activating mutations in \u03b2-catenin. In order for cancer to develop, both alleles must be mutated. Mutations in APC or \u03b2-catenin must be followed by other mutations to become cancerous; however, in carriers of an APC inactivating mutations, the risk of colorectal cancer by age 40 is almost 100%.\n\nThe impact of KRAS mutations is heavily dependent on the order of mutations. Primary KRAS mutations generally lead to a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion, but if they occur after a previous APC mutation it often progresses to cancer. KRAS mutation is predictive of a very poor response to panitumumab and cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer. Currently, the most reliable way to predict whether a colorectal cancer patient will respond to one of the EGFR-inhibiting drugs is to test for certain \u201cactivating\u201d mutations in the gene that encodes KRAS, which occurs in 30%\u201350% of colorectal cancers. Studies show patients whose tumors express the mutated version of the KRAS gene will not respond to cetuximab or panitumumab. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRAS#Colorectal_cancer).\n\nDCC can be considered a conditional tumor suppressor gene as well as a conditional oncogene. When DCC is present and not activated by netrin it is proapoptotic, and represses tumor formation. When DCC is present and netrin-activated it promotes cell survival, acting as an oncoprotein. One of the most frequent genetic abnormalities that occur in advanced colorectal cancer is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of DCC in region 18q21. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleted_in_Colorectal_Cancer).\n\n[de Miranda et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736321) suggest that TGF\u03b2 signaling remains active in some CRC cells with MSI mutations in the TGFBR2 gene, because the mutated gene still expresses a functional protein. \n\nAberrant overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is thought to have an important role in development of CRC. The tumorigenic effects of COX-2 can be attributed to the production of PGE2; increased levels of PGE2 have been reported in colorectal adenomas as well as carcinomas. COX-2 and PGE2 regulate proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion in colorectal tumors. Source: [Pino et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20420946).

    "pathwayDescription": "Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, arises from a complex interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers that disrupt the skin barrier. This dysfunction is exacerbated by alterations in the skin microbiome\u2014particularly a reduction in Staphylococcus epidermidis and an overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus\u2014which increase the skin's vulnerability to external allergens.\n\nKeratinocytes, in response to this disruption, release epithelial-derived cytokines such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin (IL)-25, and IL-33. These cytokines promote type 2 immune responses by activating group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), T helper 2 (Th2) cells, and T follicular helper 2 (Tfh2) cells. These lymphocytes, stimulated by activated Langerhans cells (LCs) and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDECs), subsequently secrete IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.\n\nIL-4 and IL-13 signal through type I (IL-4R\u03b1 / CD132) and type II (IL-4R\u03b1 / IL-13R\u03b11) receptors expressed on B cells, keratinocytes, and sensory neurons, activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Tfh2 cells promote class switching to IgE in B cells, enhancing mast cell and basophil activation via Fc\u03b5RI. Concurrently, IL-4 and IL-13 reduce the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), such as human \u03b2-defensin 3, in keratinocytes, further impairing the skin\u2019s defense.\n\nPruritus (itch) is driven by IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-33, and TSLP, which stimulate sensory neurons and perpetuate the itch-scratch cycle. Type 2 cytokines also worsen dysbiosis of the skin microbiota, while IL-5 recruits eosinophils, fueling ongoing inflammation.\n\nSeveral immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to target these pathways:\n\n* Dupilumab (brand name Dupixent) blocks IL-4R\u03b1, inhibiting both type I and type II receptor signaling.\n\n* Tralokinumab (Adbry, Adtralza) neutralizes IL-13.\n\n* Nemolizumab (Nemluvio) targets the IL-31 receptor to reduce itch.\n\n* Upadacitinib (Rinvoq) and abrocitinib (Cibinqo) are oral selective JAK1 inhibitors.\n\n* Baricitinib (Olumiant) inhibits both JAK1 and JAK2.\n\n* Topically, ruxolitinib (Jakafi, Jakavi, Opzelura; a JAK1/2 inhibitor) and delgocitinib (Corectim, a pan-JAK inhibitor) are approved for the treatment of AD.\n\nInspired by Figure 2 in [Song et al.

    "pathwayDescription": "Taken from Osteopetrosis: genetics, treatment and new insights into osteoclast function by [Cristina Sobacchi, Ansgar Schulz, Fraser P. Coxon, Anna Villa and Miep H. Helfrich](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23877423).\n\nThe osteopetroses are genetic diseases characterized by increased bone mass and density due to a failure in bone resorption. Two major forms can be distinguished on the basis of their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (ADO, formerly known as Albers-Sch\u00f6nberg disease), is usually considered an adult-onset, more benign form (and has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere); whereas autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), also termed malignant infantile osteopetrosis, presents soon after birth, is often severe and leads to death if left untreated.\n\nMechanisms underlying osteoclast-\u2011rich ARO:\nRuffled border formation and bone resorption by osteoclasts are dependent on secretory lysosome trafficking. Genes implicated in osteoclast-\u2011rich autosomal recessive osteopetrosis encode proteins that localize to secretory lysosomes in osteoclasts. TCIRG1 encodes the a3 subunit of the V0 complex, part of the V\u2011ATPase proton pump that acidifies endosomes and lysosomes; CLCN7 encodes ClC\u20117, the Cl\u2013 antiporter responsible for increasing lumenal Cl\u2013 concentration; OSTM1 encodes the \u03b2\u2011subunit of CIC\u20117; PLEKHM1 encodes a cytosolic protein that binds to the active (GTP-\u2011bound) form of Rab7, which is associated with late endosomes and lysosomes; and SNX10 encodes sorting nexin 10, which localizes to endosomes via a phosphoinositide-\u2011binding PX domain. This domain also interacts with the V1 complex D subunit of V\u2011ATPase, raising the possibility that SNX10 is involved in trafficking of V\u2011ATPase. ARO-\u2011causing mutations in all five genes disrupt trafficking of secretory lysosomes, thereby impairing ruffled-\u2011border formation and bone resorption. Osteoclast formation and adhesion to bone through the sealing zone are unaffected.\n\nMechanisms underlying osteoclast-\u2011poor ARO:\nOsteoclastogenesis is dependent on the RANK signalling pathway. In normal osteoclasts, binding of RANKL recruits TRAF6, which releases NF\u03baB from its phosphorylated inhibitor I\u03baB. NF\u03baB translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of key osteoclast genes. Osteopetrosis-\u2011causing mutations in TNFRSF11A (which encodes RANK) either reduce protein expression at the plasma membrane  or impair RANKL binding, which leads to the loss of NF\u03baB signalling and prevents differentiation and fusion of osteoclast precursors. Similarly, osteoclast differentiation defects are seen if osteopetrosis-\u2011causing mutations in TNFSF11 (which encodes RANKL) are present. Mutations identified so far lead to reduced RANKL trimerization or impaired RANK binding. Osteoclast formation studies in vitro reveal these two distinct osteoclast-\u2011poor forms of ARO: those in which osteoclastogenesis cannot be induced by synthetic RANKL (TNFRSF11A-\u2011related ARO) and those in which osteoclastogenesis can be induced by synthetic RANKL, resulting in osteoclasts that function normally (TNFSF11-\u2011related ARO). \n\nLinked with a dotted arrow to the GeneProduct nodes are diseases caused by mutation in the respective gene."

    "pathwayDescription": "The urea cycle (also known as the ornithine cycle) is a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces urea ((NH2)2CO) from ammonia (NH\u2083). This cycle occurs in ureotelic organisms. The urea cycle converts highly toxic ammonia to urea for excretion. This cycle was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered (Hans Krebs and Kurt Henseleit, 1932), five years before the discovery of the TCA cycle. The urea cycle takes place primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys. \nAmino acid catabolism results in waste ammonia. All animals need a way to excrete this product. Most aquatic organisms, or ammonotelic organisms, excrete ammonia without converting it. Ammonia is toxic, but upon excretion from aquatic species, it is diluted by the water outside the organism. Organisms that cannot easily and safely remove nitrogen as ammonia convert it to a less toxic substance such as urea or uric acid. The urea cycle mainly occurs in the liver. The urea produced by the liver is then released into the bloodstream where it travels to the kidneys and is ultimately excreted in urine. In species including birds and most insects, the ammonia is converted into uric acid or its urate salt, which is excreted in solid form.\nSource description: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle)\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP497)."

Besides \"classical\" NKH, there are several patients without mutations in the cleavage enzyme, however presenting variants within a protein related to the formation of lipoyl-H, as depicted on the righthand side of this pathway. The individual relationship between these proteins and the formation of iron-sulfur clusters (Fe-S) are not completely known, however there are indications that mutations within the NFU1, BOLA3 and GLXR5 gene can lead to a similar phenotype as NKH; most patients present with either less or more severe neurological symptoms compared to \"classical\" NKH. For clarity, the influence of pyridoxal-P has been added to this pathway, where a variant within the PNPO gene can lead to secondary effects on the activity of the P-protein from the cleavage system.\n\n\nThis pathway was inspired by Chapter 5 (edition 4) of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)), Fig. 5.1."

    "pathwayDescription": "Interleukin-7 (IL-7) was discovered in the year 1988 as a factor that enhanced the growth of murine B-cell precursors in bone marrow culture system. It was also known as lymphopoietin 1and pre-B cell factor. IL-7 plays an important role in the development of B and T cells in mouse and T cells in humans. It is also essential for mature and naive T-cell's survival and proliferation. Human IL-7 gene maps to chromosome 8 and is about 72kb in length. The protein encoded by this gene is 177 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 20 kDa. The active form of IL-7 in humans is a glycoprotein of 25 kDa. In humans IL-7 has been shown to be produced from intestinal epithelial cells, keratinocytes , hepatic tissues, peripheral blood dendritic cells, follicular dendritic cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The IL-7 receptor consists of IL-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1) and a common gamma chain (\u00ce\u00b3c). The gamma chain is also shared by IL-2, IL-4, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors. The signaling pathways activated upon IL-7 binding to the receptor complex are JAK-STAT, PI-3 kinase and Src kinase pathways. JAK3, a protein tyrosine kinase is constitutively associated with the carboxy-terminal region of the gamma chain. Studies in mice lacking JAK3 have shown that it is required for transducing \u00ce\u00b3c dependent signals. Mutations in JAK3 and \u00ce\u00b3c have been shown to be associated with the autosomal recessive form of T-B + SCID. JAK1, another protein tyrosine kinase is associated with IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 chain and is activated upon IL-7 binding. JAK1 deficient mice shows severely impaired thymic development and no hematopoietic colony formation in response to IL-7. IL-7 would first bind to IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 and then associates with the gamma chain, bringing their intracellular domains bearing JAK1 and JAK3 together. JAK3 phosphorylates IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 chain creating docking sites for the transcription factors, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate these STAT molecules and induces their dimerization and translocation to the nucleus where they activate specific target genes. PTK2B, a protein tyrosine kinase has been shown to be associated with JAK1 and plays an important role in the survival of thymocyte cell line. The enzymatic activity and its phosphorylation are highly induced by IL-7. PI-3 kinase pathway is also activated by IL-7 and this pathway is essential for the survival and proliferation of human T cell precursors. PI-3 kinase interacts with IL-7R\u00ce\u00b1 upon IL-7 stimulation and activates its downstream target, AKT and its activation is mediated by \u00ce\u00b3c. AKT in turn activates GSK3 beta and Bad, the death protein. Survival of pro T-cell survival by regulating Bad via PI3 kinase/AKT pathway is mediated by IL-7. IL-7 also mediates the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B through the PI-3 kinase pathway and this effect is required for cell proliferation. IL-7 also induces the phosphorylation of a Src kinase family member, Fyn which is constitutively associated with IL7RA. In addition, IL-7 induces phosphorylation of MAPK family members including MAPK1 and MAPK3.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_7_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

The CDKN2A encodes two proteins, p16 (INK4A) and p14ARF, with different functions. p16 binds to CDK4, which prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby controlling the G1 to S transition. Without functioning p16, G1 to S transition can proceed. p14ARF is central to cell cycle regulation, inhibiting MDM2, which normally degrades p53, so loss of p14ARF has a similar effect to loss of p53. \n\nProtein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.\n"

    "pathwayDescription": "The Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins belong to the class V HLH family of transcription factors. Four ID proteins (ID 1-4)are known in humans. Unlike the basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, ID proteins lack the basic DNA binding region. They can heterodimerize with class I bHLH transcription factors to form inactive complexes. They thus act as dominant negative inhibitors of the class I bHLH transcription factors. They are also capable of regulating the activity of class II HLH transcription factors. Since, class I and II HLH proteins regulate the expression of cell type-specific genes and differentiated phenotype, ID proteins are thought to regulate the cross-talk between the pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation. Aberrant expression of ID proteins are found in many primary tumors and are found to regulate many steps in cancer progression including neo-angiogenesis, invasion and migration, proliferation and growth, cell-cell interaction and differentiation. These include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinonoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer  and prostate cancer. Among the transcription factors that ID proteins associate with are the Ets family members (ELKs)  and paired box family (PAXs). They can also bind to the retinoblastoma and retinoblastoma-like proteins (RBLs), which are thought to be tumor suppressors.

This interaction leads to the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)kB, PI3K/Akt, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) (ERK and p38) pathways. As a result, there is an increase in megakarycoyte maturation, including increased adhesion, increases in ploidy, and increases in mRNA production of inflammatory and thrombotic genes. IL1-beta can also bind IL1R1 on platelets and either enhance aggregation induced by agonists or promote adhesion and heterotypic aggregate formation.\n\nSome of the data used to create the pathway was generated in mouse (noted in pathway), however the pathway represents human homologs of those genes.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2865)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is a potent growth factor belonging to the super family of cytokines. IL-3 is a 20- 32kDa glycoprotein involved in the process of hematopoiesis. It is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of pleuripotent hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells and their mature progeny. IL-3 is a growth factor for B lymphocytes. It also activates monocytes and augments survival and propagation of mast cells, eosinophils and stromal cells. IL-3 is secreted predominantly by activated T lymphocytes in response to immunological stimuli and to a lesser extent by mast cells and eosinophils. IL-3 exerts influence on different biological activities, primarily hematopoiesis by associating with the IL-3 receptor. This receptor is a heterodimeric complex and consists of an alpha chain- IL3RA and a beta chain CSF2RB, shared with the receptors for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and Interleukin-5. When IL-3 binds to CSF2RB receptor, adapter proteins like SHC1, GRB2 and SOS1 are recruited to activate HRAS. HRAS stimulates RAF1 which further activates MAP2K1 and finally MAPK1 and MAPK3. The signals generated through this pathway are then transmitted to the nucleus leading to the activation of various transcription factors such as JUN and FOS which are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. IL-3 mediated activation of HRAS also inhibits apoptosis through phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase/ AKT pathway. The activation of AKT1 in response to IL-3 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of the apoptotic regulator, BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), its binding to 14-3-3 and sequestration into the cytoplasm. IL-3 stimulation activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) by its phosphorylation. JAK2 in turn phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A and 5B. These translocate to the nucleus, serving the purpose of transcription factor for early genes as well as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway. IL-3, in addition, is known to activate various tyrosine kinases such as LYN, FYN, SRC, SYK, TEC1 and HCK. The interactions and intersections between canonical and noncanonical IL-3 signaling systems are depicted in the pathway map.\n\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_3_pathway.html) database.\n\nIf you use this pathway, please cite following paper:\nKandasamy, K., Mohan, S.

On the other hand it is known from several viruses that they can hijack the cellular autophagy system for proliferation [10.1074/jbc.M306124200]. For human coronaviruses it is presumed that coronaviruses stimulate the initiation of autophagy due to infection initiated stress for which PIK3R4 (VPS15), PIK3C3 (VPS34) and BECN1 (beclin1) are key proteins. Additionally, nsp6 (and nsp567 from other virus species than SARS-CoV) inhibit maturation of autolysosomes.

In response, these receptors work with other proteins to regulate the expression of specific genes, thereby controlling the development, homeostasis, and metabolism of the organism.\n\nNuclear receptors have the ability to directly bind to DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes, hence these receptors are classified as transcription factors. The regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptors generally only happens when a ligand is present. More specifically, ligand binding to a nuclear receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor, which, in turn, activates the receptor, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression.\n\nA unique property of nuclear receptors that differentiates them from other classes of receptors is their ability to directly interact with and control the expression of genomic DNA. As a consequence, nuclear receptors play key roles in both embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Nuclear receptors may be classified according to either mechanism or homology.\n[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia]"

    "pathwayTitle": "Leptin signaling",
    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP2034",
    "pathwayDescription": "Leptin is a peptide hormone mainly synthesised and secreted from adipocytes. It is also expressed in other tissues including placenta, stomach and skeletal muscle. Leptin mediates its effects by binding to its receptor, leptin receptor (LEPR). LEPR belongs to gp130 family of cytokine receptor. LEPR is expressed in many tissues such as brain, adipose tissue, heart, placenta, lung and liver. Alternative splicing of LEPR results in six different isoforms, LEPRa, LEPRb, LEPRc, LEPRd, LEPRe and LEPRf. LEPRb is the longest isoform and possess signaling capacity. The role of other isoforms in leptin signaling is not clear. Leptin plays a major role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin is found to be transported to various regions of the brain across blood brain barrier. Impairment in leptin signaling across the blood brain barrier induces leptin resistance and thus obesity. Leptin is known to regulate reproduction, bone homeostasis and immune signaling. Leptin is also implicated in various physiological processers such as angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. LEPRb forms a homodimer and binds to leptin in 1:1 stoichiometry. This tetrameric receptor/ ligand complex appears to be essential for signaling. Leptin receptor lacks intrinsic kinase activity. It mediates multiple signaling pathways by binding to cytoplasmic kinases such as Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2). Activation of JAK2 by leptin promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb at Tyr-986, Try-1078 and Tyr-1141, thus activating LEPRb. Activation of leptin receptor with leptin activates signaling modules such as JAK/STAT, RAS/RAF/MAPK, IRS1/PI-3K, PLC\u03b3 and AMPK/ACC modules. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LEPRb induces binding of STATs to LEPRb. Binding of STATs to the phosphorylated residues of LEPR leads to the JAK2 mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of STATs. Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus and induces expression of genes such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1). SOCS3 mediates feedback inhibition of leptin pathway by binding to Tyr-986 residue of LEPR. Cytosolic PTP1B also negatively regulates leptin pathway by dephosphorylating JAK2 and STAT3. Binding of leptin to its receptor results in the phosphorylation of PTPN1. Phosphorylated PTPN11 provides a docking site for GRB2, resulting in the activation of ERK module through RAS-RAF-MEK signaling. Leptin induces the activation of PI-3K by promoting the interaction and formation of SH2B/JAK2/IRS complex. Activation PI-3K mediates the activation of activation of protein kinases such as protein kinase B (AKT1) and downstream signaling cascades such as mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and phosphodiesterase 3A, cGMP-inhibited (PDE3A). Activated AKT also regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3A/B) proteins. IkappaB kinases (IKKs) are activated in response to AKT activation. Activated IKKs induce nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Leptin also regulates 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. AMPK function as energy sensor and is activated in response to rise in AMP to ATP ratio. Activated AMPK regulate fatty acid biosymthesis by regulating the activity the enzyme, fatty acid biosynthesis-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). PLC gamma is activated in response to leptin signaling. Activated PLC gamma regulate intracellular calcium levels and also protein kinase C activation by hydrolysing phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG).\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/Leptin_pathway.html) database.\nIf you use this pathway, please cite the following paper: Nanjappa, V., Raju, R., Muthusamy, B., Sharma, J., Thomas, J.

These modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing, which occur in the cell nucleus before the RNA is translated.\n\n5' Capping: Capping of the pre-mRNA involves the addition of 7-methylguanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. The cap protects the 5' end of the primary RNA transcript from attack by ribonucleases that have specificity to the 3'5' phosphodiester bonds.\n\n3' Processing: The pre-mRNA processing at the 3' end of the RNA molecule involves cleavage of its 3' end and then the addition of about 200 adenine residues to form a poly(A) tail. As the poly(A) tails is synthesised, it binds multiple copies of poly(A) binding protein, which protects the 3'end from ribonuclease digestion.\n\nSplicing: RNA splicing is the process by which introns, regions of RNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. \n\nDescription adapted from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transcriptional_modification\n\nPathway adapted from http://www.reactome.org.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP411)."

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP2572",
    "pathwayDescription": "Primary or idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents.  It is also an important cause of end stage renal disease in adults. FSGS is mainly associated with foot process effacement, proliferation of mesangial, endothelial and epithelial cells in the early stages followed by collapse of glomerular capillaries leading to scarring. It may lead to dramatic manifestations such as proteinuria, hypoaluminemia, and hypertension. Also, there are many inheritable genetic abnormalities that can cause podocyte damage of FSGS caused by mutations in proteins that are important for podocyte function. The genes include CD2AP, MYO1E, WNT1, and LAMB2.\nOn the far left, the diagram illustrates molecular interactions between a normal podocyte and matrix interactions. ACTN4 and SYNPO and DAG1 interacting with AGRN associate with the actin cytoskeleton; these actin associated proteins might play a role in maintaining podocyte and GBM architecture. DAG1 binds to UTRN, which in turn binds an actin filament, thus completing the link between the actin-based cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Podocyte foot processes are anchored to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) via ITGB1 and ITGA3 integrin complex and DAG1-UTRN complex. Transmembrane proteins such as LAMA5 and CD151 bind to ITGB1 and ITGA3, respectively. The intracellular integrins combine with cytoskeletal via intermediates which include TLN1, VCL, and PAX complex and the ILK, PARVA, and LIMS1 complex. (Guanghua Hu et. al 2013 - Biomedicine and Aging Pathology vol 3)\nUpon primary podocyte injury, there are multiple pathways involved in podocyte injury. \"Sustaining NPHS1 and phosphorylation might contribute to both anti-apoptotic signaling and actin polymerization. The CD80 pathway may be targeted by TLR4 or blocking the binding of B7-1 to slit diaphragm structure proteins such as KIRREL2/3. PLAUR could be inhibited by interfering with binding of PLAUR and ITGAV/B3 integrin, inhibiting ITGB3 integrin activation, or inhibiting binding of ITGAV/B3 integrin to VTN. The notch pathway can be targeted by interfering with its upstream activation by blocking the TGF-\u03b21 effect, inhibiting \u03b3-secretase, which is required for proteolytic receptor activation, or interfering with target gene transcription.\" (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77) Post podocyte development, increased activation of NOTCH1 and WNT/CTNNB1 activities contribute to glomerulosclerosis. Expression of JAG1 on the ligand-expressing cell induces proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor on the signal-receiving cell, releasing the NOTCH1. DKK1 inhibits WNT1 binding to LRP5/6. By inhibiting the destruction of CTNNB1, CTNNB1 is stablilized. \"The CTSL pathway could be targeted by specifically inhibiting CTSL expression or activity, shifting the equilibrium of SYNPO toward the phosphorylated form by inhibiting calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation or enhancing PKA or CAMK2B-mediated phosphorylation, protecting SYNPO and DNM1 by compounds that bind to the CTSL cleavage site, or delivering cleavage-resistant SYNPO and DNM1 mutants.\" (Reiser J. et al 2010 - Kidney Int vol 77)\nThe destruction of podocyte's cytoskeleton architecture leads to lose of normal podocyte epitopes such as VIM, SYNPO, and WT1, and lose of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1C and CDKN1B. Also, podocytes acquire proliferation of CDKN1A. This leads to podocytopenia which have been shown to cause primary FSGS and then followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD). FSGS is also induced by microRNA-193a and its downregulation of WT1, destroying podocyte foot processes.\nThere is insufficient evidence that segmental glomerular lesions can be caused by other drugs or toxins, apart from some used experimentally such as doxorubicin and puromycin aminonucleoside. \nTreatments such as steroids, high-dose cyclosporine, ritxuximab can reduce proteinuria based on their immunosuppressive properties and through stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton. \n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2572)."

When MEK, the kinase upstream of ERK in the MAPK cascade, was inhibited in conditioned medium-stimulated endothelial cells, it decreased PARP1 expression. On the other hand, overexpressing p-ERK2 in neurons led to an increase in PARP1 activity.\n\n\nERK signaling also influences Tankyrase 1 activity. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes stimulated by insulin, PDGF, and EGF, ERK phosphorylates Tankyrase 1.\n\n\nJNK1 has been suggested as a positive regulator of PARP1 activation during H2O2-induced cell death in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In the context of multiple myeloma, JNK2 enhances PARP14 protein levels through an unknown mechanism.\n\n\n*Positive regulation:*\n\nMAPK signaling is positively regulated by PARP1 and Tankyrase 1/2. Under normal conditions, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) by MEK1/2 (MAPKK) induces conformational changes that activate ERK1/2, leading to the phosphorylation of downstream targets that promote cell growth, survival, and migration.\n\n\nPerfusing rat hearts with a cytostatic agent increased cardiotoxicity and phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. Inhibition of PARP1-dependent ADP-ribosylation with BGP-15 significantly reduces MAPK phosphorylation.\n\n\nPARP1 activation also correlates with JNK and p38 signaling in various cell types, especially in the context of ROS-dependent PARP1 activation and cell death, which depends on JNK and/or p38 signaling.\n\n\nAlthough primarily observed in Drosophila melanogaster rather than mammalian cells, Tankyrase 1/2 have been implicated in JNK activation.\n\n\n*Negative regulation:*\n\nIn the case of Salmonella infection in human colonic epithelial cells, PARP inhibitor PJ-34 treatment increases ERK phosphorylation, NF-\u03baB signaling, and IL-6 production/secretion, even at early time points.\n\n\nInhibition of PARP1 increased ERK activation and reduced cell death in H2O2-induced apoptosis of human WRL-68 cells, while simultaneously lowering p-JNK and p-p38 levels. PARP14 interacts with and likely ADP-ribosylate JNK1, inhibiting its kinase activity and reducing JNK1-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, inhibition of PARP14 with PJ-34 leads to increased JNK1 activity and enhanced cell death."

    "pathwayDescription": "Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the ganglion type and the CNS type.\n\nIn dopaminergic neurons in the CNS, nicotine binds to the CNS-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The main type of CNS receptor is composed of alpha 4 beta 2 (CHRNA4, CHRNB2) subunits. It has been shown that alpha 6, alpha 5, and beta 3 can also be in the receptor complex to modulate binding sensitivity. By binding to the receptor, nicotine causes cell depolarization and release of dopamine from the cell through the SNARE complex. Dopamine then binds to dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, DRD4) on dopaminergic terminals and activates Gi alpha (GNAI1), initiating a feedback loop to inhibit dopamine release. One of the key players mediating dopamine signaling is PPP1R1B (also called DARPP-32, dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phospho-protein). PPP1R1B is a bifunctional signal transduction molecule which, by distinct mechanisms, inhibits either a serine/threonine kinase (PPKACA or PKA) or a serine/threonine phosphatase (PPP1CA or protein phosphatase 1). When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by PPKACA at threonine 34, it is an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), which inhibits dopamine secretion through the SNARE complex. When PPP1R1B is phosphorylated by CDK5 at threonine 75, it is converted to an inhibitor of PPKACA. Binding of dopamine to D2-like dopamine receptors leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase (ADCY2) via G-protein GNAI1, and decreases PKA-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34. This, in turn, relieves the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1CA), and inhibits further dopamine release.\n\nSources: [Nicotine Pathway in Dopaminergic Neurons (PharmGKB)](https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA162355621), [Nicotine (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine).\n\nProtein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1602)."

    "pathwayDescription": "The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a highly conserved module that is involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1/2 for ERK1/2, MKK3/6 for the p38, MKK4/7 (JNKK1/2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.\n\nDescription reference: [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:map04010).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP382).\n\nProtein phosphorylation sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus (R), www.phosphosite.org."

There are three pathways of complement activation: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. All of these pathways generate a crucial enzymatic activity that, intern, generates the effector molecules of complement.

As can be seen, various transports bring these two amino acids across the blood brain barrier and into the oligodendrocyte where the actual synthesis of carnosine happens by CARNS1. The degradation of carnosine also occurs within the oligodendrocyte by CN1 and CN2. \nThe oligdendrocytes are the only glial cells in the brain which produce carnosine, but all of them use it, so distribution to other glial cells is necessary. The transport to microglia is done by SLC14A2 and 4, while transport to astrocytes only requires SLC14A2.\nCarnosine also has an impact on the glutamate transporter of the astrocyte, which is SLC1A2, also known as GLT-1. Carnosine stimulates the transporter, which brings more glutamate and sodium into the cell. The sodium concentration within the cell will be increased, leading to a higher activity of the ATPase. This generates more ADP, which can be used within glycolysis. This then builds a connected to the lactate shuttle which occurs between the astrocyte and neurons, in which the astrocyte produces lactate from pyruvate to give the neurons additional energy support."

    "pathwayDescription": "The complement activation takes place through one or more of the well-established (alternative, classical or lectin) pathways consisting of plasma and membrane-bound proteins. All three pathways converge at the level of complement C3 ([doi:10.6072/H0.MP.A004235.01](https://doi.org/10.6072/H0.MP.A004235.01)) and are controlled by regulators ([doi:10.1038/ni.1923](https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1923)). Complement C3 belongs to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family of proteins, and consists of a alpha-chain and an beta-chain. Cleavage of C3 which can be initiated by one or more of the above three distinct pathways, into C3b [Proteolysis@23-667,749-1663] and C3a [Proteolysis@672-748] is an important step in the complement activation cascade. Classical and lectin pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens (or immune complexes) use C3-convertase [C4b2a] to cleave complement C3 into C3a and C3b ([doi:10.1084/jem.125.2.359](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.125.2.359)). However, in alternative pathway a small fraction of the C3 molecules are hydrolyzed to C3(H20) exposing new binding sites. This hydrated C3 [C3(H20)] recruits complement factor B [fB], which is then cleaved by complement factor D [fD] to result in formation of the minor form of C3-convertase [C3(H20)Bb] that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b ([doi:10.1084/jem.154.3.856](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.154.3.856)). Further, addition of C3b to C3 convertase [C3bBb or C4b2a] results in C5 convertase [C3bBb3b or C4b2a3b], that cleaves complement C5 to C5a and C5b, is the last enzymatic step of the complement activation cascade ([doi:10.1074/jbc.273.27.16828](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2387864)). During complement activation C5b interacts with complement C6, C7, C8 and C9 in a sequential and non-catalyzed manner to result in the formation of Terminal Complement Complex (TCC) ([doi:10.1074/jbc.M111.219766](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M111.219766)). The entire network is considered as a simple recognition and elimination system of host-immune complexes and apoptotic and/or pathogens, and therefore promotes host immune homeostasis. The complement system is also involved in cross-talk with other processes related to coagulation, lipid metabolism and cancer. However, many pathogens counteract complement attack through a range of different mechanisms, such acquisition of host complement regulators to the surface of pathogen, or secretion of complement inactivation factors. In order to have a holistic view of the entire complement network, Dr. John D.Lambris group (University of Pennsylvania) developed the Complement Map Database (CMAP) which is a unique repository focused on documented molecular interactions described within the complement cascade and between complement and other biological systems. Information contained in [CMAP](http://www.complement.us/cmap/index.php) (see doi:[10.1093/bioinformatics/btt269](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt269)) is entirely based on published experimental data and is fully revised by experts in the field.

NAMPT converts nicotinamide to nicotinamide mononucleotide for NAD+ synthesis. PGC-1a is the regulator of mitochondrial biosynthesis (increasing mitochondrial cell mass to produce more ATP) which thus will increase if more PGC-1a is released.\nLevels of NAD rise during caloric restriction leading to increased SIRT1 activity. SIRT1 blocks the Insulin/IGF-1 pathway. This is a very complex and paradoxal tissue, which need further investigation/research.\nIncreased SIRT1 activity leads to activation of FOXO/p53 genes.

Increased peripheral levels of these gut-derived satiety hormones induce the recruitment of microvasculature in skeletal muscle tissue and thereby contribute to improved insulin signalling. Furthermore SCFA induce a reduction in lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT), resulting in enhanced WAT lipid buffering capacity and decreased levels ectopic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue. \n\nSCFA are also suggested to have direct effects on skeletal muscle metabolism, possibly via GPR41 and GPR43 signalling. SCFA  induce the activation of  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator in skeletal muscle cell metabolism. Activated AMPK induces several metabolic pathways including fatty acid oxidation and the synthesis of glycogen. Active AMPK also stimulates glucose uptake via translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and decreases glycolysis.

The defining JS feature is the molar tooth sign (MTS), which is the particular manner in which a characteristic malformation of midbrain appears in radiological imaging, and which causes delays in both intellectual and motor development. A visual representation of the pathways underlying JS pathogenesis was synthesized, which might provide a more complete understanding of the disease, possibly aiding in better diagnosis and more successful treatment.\nData collection on the genes, pathways and interactions involved was done through a literature search in combination supported by online databases such as OMIM, STRING and GeneMANIA. The pathway was created using PathVisio version 3.3.0. Nodes were annotated using the appropriate Ensembl, ChEBI, or Uniprot-TrEMBL identifiers and standardized MIM notation was used to visualize the interactions between them.\n\nA final pathway containing 88 unique nodes and 71 interactions was created. The pathway highlights three functional or structural areas of the primary cilium that appear to play important roles in JS pathogenesis, namely the basal body or centriole, the transition zone and ciliary trafficking. Furthermore, two specific complexes seem to be of particular interest; the B9 ciliary complex and the centriolar satellite contain eight and three JS-associated protein respectively. Lastly, the ARL13B-PDE6D-INPP5E signaling network ensures the proper functioning of INPP5E, and enzyme that converts lipid ciliary membrane components.

In eukaryotes, the de novo pathway starts with tryptophan (this pathway).\nThe role of tryptophan as a precursor in eukaryotic NAD biosynthesis was first suggested by nutritional studies in which humans stricken with pellagra, a nicotinamide (niacine) deficiency disease, recovered after the addition of tryptophan or niacin to their diets (Krehl et al). Other studies established tryptophan as a precursor of NAD in many animal and plant systems (Foster et al). This pathway is closely related to the catabolic pathway of tryptophan (tryptophan degradation I (via anthranilate)), suggesting an evolutionary link between the two.\n\nThough rare, the synthesis of NAD from tryptophan in prokaryotes has been observed in several organisms. Wilson and Henderson reported that Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni requires niacin for growth and can use tryptophan or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid as a substitute [Wilson63]. Some members of the Actinomycete group were also reported to utilize tryptophan for NAD biosynthesis (Lingens et al).\n\nRecent studies based on comparative genome analysis have identified the five genes involved in the \"eukaryotic\" pathway in several bacterial strains, confirming that some bacteria may indeed utilize this pathway rather than the aspartate pathway (Kurnasov et al).\n\nIn yeast, the de novo pathway consists of six enzymatic steps (catalyzed by the products of the BNA genes) and one non-enzymatic reaction. After the last enzymatic reaction (catalyzed by Bna6p), the de novo pathway converges with the salvage pathway (Panozzo et al).\n\nIn plants:\n\nIn plants current evidence strongly supports the NAD biosynthetic route from L-aspartate (NAD biosynthesis I (from aspartate)). However, the finding of gene homologs encoding enzymes of the early steps in the kynurenine pathway (this pathway) in the genome sequence of rice (Oryza sativa) does not rule out this pathway in monocotyledones and remains to be further investigated (Katoh et al).\n\nAdapted from   [BioCyc](http://biocyc.org/META/new-image?type=PATHWAY&object=NADSYN-PWY&detail-level=3&ENZORG=TAX-9606).\n"

Smaller anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a) mediate chemotaxis of immune cells and vasoactivation. Furthermore, complement regulator proteins such as SERPING1, Factor H, CSMD1 and CD59 negatively regulate the cascade. \n\nAdditionally, C3d/CR2 signaling inhibits adult NPC proliferation (green).

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP2324",
    "pathwayDescription": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are heterogeneous group of non-enzymatic malliard reaction products of aldose sugar with proteins and lipids. Formation of AGEs is an indicator of one of the many chemical modifications of proteins and DNA that occur within the biological systems. Research over past two decades have implicated the role of AGEs in most of the age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal disorders, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment and skin disorders. AGEs also modify the skin collagen and accelerates the aging process. In diabetic patients, AGE formation occurs in large scale and manifests with clinical symptoms such as cataract, atherosclerosis, nephropathy and neuropathy.\n\nAGEs are known to bind with different cell surface receptors such as receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), dolichyldiphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (AGE-R1), protein kinase C substrate, 80KH phosphoprotein (AGE-R2), galectin-3 (AGE-R3), and class A macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II.  RAGE, is the well-studied receptor for AGEs and the signaling events mediated by others are either not been identified or are considered as negative regulators of RAGE signaling. RAGE is an integral membrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is constituted of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain. RAGE is expressed in a wide range of tissues such as lung, heart, kidney, brain, skeletal muscles, and in different types of cells including endothelial cells, macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Besides AGEs, RAGE also mediate the effects of its other extracellular ligands namely extracellular high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), S100 family of calcium binding proteins and amyloid-beta peptide, among many others. Although a large number of advanced glycation end products have been identified in humans, AGE/RAGE signaling ex-vivo is mostly studied using the AGEs such as AGE-modified albumin, N(6)(carboxymethyl)lysine, N(6)(carboxyethyl)lysine and pentosidine.\n\nThe signaling events mediated by RAGE are complex due to the diversity of its ligands and their effects in different cell types. Homodimerization of RAGE has been identified to be essential for RAGE signaling. Depending on the intensity and duration of RAGE ligation, specific signaling modules such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, CDC42/RAC, SAPK/JNK and NF-\u03baB has been shown to be regulated in different cell types. AGEs have been shown to induce the formation of complexes containing RAGE with DIAPH1, SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha, TIRAP/MYD88/IRAK4 and RHOA. RAGE-DIAPH1 interaction is required for the activation of RAC1/CDC42 pathway leading to neurite outgrowth and regulation of cytoskeleton.Activation of PKC-alpha through RAGE/SRC/IRS1/PKC-alpha by AGEs has been suggested as a mechanism of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle cells. RAGE also shares the adaptor molecules such as TIRAP, MYD88 and IRAK4 of toll-like receptors and induce the activation of AKT, p38MAPK and NFKB pathways. AGEs have also been shown to induce the formation of complex between RAGE and RHOA. RHOA/ROCK dependent phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) is required for the regulation of gap formation and actin reorganization, and thereby endothelial permeability. However, in tubular cells, AGEs inhibit phosphorylation of ERMs leading to inhibition of tubulogenesis. Similarly, AKT have been shown to be activated by AGEs and induce proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells where as phosphorylation of AKT is shown to be inhibited in podocytes leading to FOXO4 activation and apoptosis. The major component of AGE/RAGE signaling is the oxidative stress induced pathways. AGEs induce the oxidative stress through the activation of NADPH oxidases. Increased intracellular oxidative stress leads to stimulation of PKC and ERK1/2, resulting in the translocation and activation of NF-\u03baB and subsequent up regulation of NF-\u03baB dependent genes which ultimately produce deleterious effects to cells. \nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/age_signaling_pathways.html) database.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2324)"

This pathway was adapted in large part from [KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05330.html). In the initial step of this diagram, antigen presenting cells (APC's), either those from the donor (direct pathway) or from the recipient (indirect pathway) activate naive t cells leading to both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell maturation. CD8+ stimulated T cells lead to apoptosis of the allograft donor cells whereas CD4+ T cells differentiate into TH1, TH2, T17, and Treg cells. Activated TH1 produces TNFA and NO and damages donor graft cells by cytotoxicity. TH2 cell activates B cells. Activated B cells lead to plasma cell formation followed by IgG antibodies and the complement cascade pathway in acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and chronic AMR with C3 being the therapeutic target. Exogenous treatment with YCF inhibits C3, thus preventing AMR. Eculizumab binds to C5 which prevent C5a production and the membrane attack complex.  C3a and C35 act as potent chemotactic factors, promoting the infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells. Belatacept inhibits CD80/86 binding to CD28. Corticosteroids inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines.

And second, by ubiquitinating ASC (PYCARD) in the NLRP3 inflammasome, which leads to its degradtion and the activation of caspase-1 (CASP1) that goes on to catalyze the production of mature IL-1B, leading to a cytokine storm. While Orf3a of SARS-CoV-2 only has 72.7% sequence identity with that of SARS-CoV, the TRAF3 binding motif PxQxS is 100% conserved (https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/#Orf3a).

Initiation in unicellular eukaryotes, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), is well understood, and has served as a model for studies of DNA replication initiation in multicellular eukaryotes, including humans. In general terms, the first step of initiation is the binding of the replication initiator to the origin of replication. The replicative helicase is then assembled onto the origin, usually by a helicase assembly factor. Either shortly before or shortly after helicase assembly, some local unwinding of the origin of replication occurs in a region rich in adenine and thymine bases (often termed a DNA unwinding element, DUE). The unwound region provides the substrate for primer synthesis and initiation of DNA replication. The best-defined eukaryotic origins are those of S. cerevisiae, which have well-conserved sequence elements for initiator binding, DNA unwinding and binding of accessory proteins. In multicellular eukaryotes, unlike S. cerevisiae, these loci appear not to be defined by the presence of a DNA sequence motif. Indeed, choice of replication origins in a multicellular eukaryote may vary with developmental stage and tissue type. In cell-free models of metazoan DNA replication, such as the one provided by Xenopus egg extracts, there are only limited DNA sequence specificity requirements for replication initiation.\n\n\nSource description: http://www.reactome.org/content/detail/69306.

IL23 inhibitors like risankizumab (Skyrizi), guselkumab (Tremfya), mirikizumab (Omvoh), and brazikumab (MEDI2070) bind to IL23p19 (a.k.a. p19), the protein product of gene IL23A.  That in turn blocks IL23A protein from binding to its receptor in immune cells, preventing the production of downstream inflammatory interleukins, cytokines, and other factors that manifest as IBD.\n\nIL-23 plays a crucial role in immune responses, especially in the intestinal mucosa. It has a novel p19 protein subunit, which interacts with the p40 subunit. This interaction activates the STAT4-JAK2 pathway. Major cells producing IL-23 include macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, particularly in response to microbial stimuli via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can also produce IL-23.\n\nIL-23 binds to its receptor, which consists of two subunits: IL12 receptor \u03b21 (common to both IL-12 and IL-23 receptors) and IL23R\u03b1. The binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor, activating the JAK2 and TYK2 kinases, which then phosphorylate each other and the receptor itself. This phosphorylation allows for the binding of STAT proteins, mainly STAT3. These phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they activate ROR\u03b3t, a master transcription factor that drives the expression of IL-17-related genes.\n\nThis signaling pathway primarily promotes the proliferation of Th17 cells, rather than their differentiation, since naive T cells lack IL-23 receptors. The activation also induces the production of various cytokines, including IL-17A/F, IL-22, IL-6, GM-CSF, TNF\u03b1, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) by IECs. In addition to Th17 cells, other immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells, natural killer T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), and dendritic cells, are also involved in this IL-23-driven immune response.\n\nInspired by [figure 1, Bourgonje et al. 2025](https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(24)05124-2/fulltext)."

    "pathwayDescription": "Psoriasis can be triggered by environmental stressors and physical trauma, particularly in individuals with genetic predispositions such as PSORS1. These triggers promote the release of chemokines CCL20, CXCL8, and CXCL1, which in turn recruit CCR6\u207aIL-17\u207a lymphocytes, neutrophils, and IL-23\u207aCD14\u207a dendritic cells (DCs), respectively. IL-17-producing cells -- including Th17, Tc17, and ILC3 -- release IL-17A and IL-17F, which activate the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex on keratinocytes, amplifying the inflammatory cascade. Additionally, IL-22 produced by ILC3 cells contributes to keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Dendritic cells further release pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-23. IL-23 promotes the expansion and activity of IL-17-producing cells via the JAK2/TYK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.\n\nTargeted therapies include ustekinumab (brand name Stelara), which blocks the p40 subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23, and guselkumab (Tremfya) and risankizumab (Skyrizi), which inhibit the IL-23-specific p19 subunit. IL-17A is targeted by secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz), while bimekizumab (Bimzelx) neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F. Brodalumab (Siliq, Kyntheum) inhibits IL-17RA, disrupting downstream signaling. For JAK pathway inhibition, deucravacitinib (Sotyktu) selectively targets TYK2, and brepocitinib inhibits both TYK2 and JAK1.\n\nInspired by Figure 1 in [Song et al.

    "pathwayDescription": "Flavin-containing monooxygenases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the oxygenation of substrates, mostly soft nucleophiles via the cofactor flavin. In the catalytic cycle, FMO binds to NADPH and to FAD, causing the reduction of FAD to FADH2. Next, molecular oxygen binds to the complex and is reduced to a hydroperoxide form, called 4a-hydroperoxyflavin. This complex is stable in the absence of a substrate. When a substrate is present, the distal O-atom of the complex is transferred to the substrate yielding an oxygenated product and leaving the flavincomplex 4a-hydroxyflavin that breaks down releasing water. At the end of the cycle, NADP+ is released resulting in FAD as the flavin form to start a next cycle.  \nIn contrast to cytochrome P450 enzymes, FMOs are generally not induced or inhibited by xenobiotic substances. The five human FMOs are tissue specific: FMO1 is present in the human fetal liver and the adult kidney, FMO2 is present in the lung and FMO3 is present in the adult liver."

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP500",
    "pathwayDescription": "Glycogen is a very large, branched polymer of glucose residues. Within skeletal muscle and liver glucose is stored as glycogen. In the liver, glycogen synthesis and degradation are regulated to maintain blood-glucose levels as required to meet the needs of the organism as a whole. In contrast, in muscle, these processes are regulated to meet the energy needs of the muscle itself. \n\n'''Glycogen synthesis''' is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic. This means that glycogen synthesis requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from UTP, which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose by the enzyme glycogen synthase, which progressively lengthens the glycogen chain with (a1->4) bonded glucose. As glycogen synthase can only lengthen an existing chain, the protein glycogenin is needed to initiate the synthesis of glycogen. The glycogen-branching enzyme, amylo (a1->4) to (a1->6) transglycosylase, catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of 6-7 glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.\n\n'''Glycogen degradation''' consists of three steps: (1) the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen, (2) the remodeling of the glycogen substrate to permit further degradation, and (3) the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glucose 6-phosphate for further metabolism.\n\nInformation partly derived from \"Biochemistry\" by Stryer and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP500)"

DHCR7 encodes the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase, which converts 7-DHC to cholesterol, thereby removing the substrate from the synthetic pathway of vitamin D3, a precursor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3.The finding that common variants at DHCR7 are strongly associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations suggests that this enzyme could have a larger role in regulation of vitamin D status than has previously been recognised. Vitamin D3, obtained from the isomerization of pre-vitamin D3 in the epidermal basal layers or intestinal absorption of natural and fortified foods and supplements, binds to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. D3 is hydroxylated by liver 25-hydroxylases (25-OHase). The resultant 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) is 1-hydroxylated in the kidney by 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 -hydroxylase (1-OHase). This yields the active secosteroid 1 ,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), which has different effects on various target tissues. The synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3 from 25(OH)D3 is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and suppressed by Ca2+, Pi and 1,25(OH)2D3 itself. The rate-limiting step in catabolism is the degradation of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 to 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3, respectively,which occurs through 24-hydroxylation by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (24-OHase), encoded by the CYP24A1 gene. 24,25(OH)D3 and 1,24,25(OH)2D3 are consequently excreted. Vitamin D activity is mediated through binding of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which can regulate transcription of other genes involved in cell regulation, growth, and immunity. VDR modulates the expression of genes by forming a heterodimer complex with retinoid-X-receptors (RXR).\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP1531)."

    "pathwayDescription": "IL-11 is a multifunctional cytokine that belongs to the gp130 family. It was first isolated from a primate bone marrow derived cell line, PU-34 for its ability to stimulate the proliferation of a plasmacytoma cell line, T1165 which was dependent on IL-6. This cytokine plays an important role in the synthesis, maturation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. It  also plays significant role in the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, regulation of trophoblasts invasion and placentation in humans. \n\nThe receptor for IL-11 is IL11RA that uses the common gp130 receptor subunit for signal transduction. The pathways that are activated upon IL-11 stimulation are JAK-STAT, Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65. Binding of IL-11 with IL-11RA results in the heterodimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of gp130. The activated IL11RA-gp130 receptor complex further activates Jak family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. Phosphorylated JAK2 then activates STAT3 and STAT1 that results in their subsequent translocation into the nucleus. The translocated STAT3 then induces the transcription of genes associated with endometrial cell adhesion, gastric inflammation and differentiation of periodontal ligament cells. The activation of STAT3 was shown to be inhibited by the overexpression of Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3). IL-11 signalling through JAK2/STAT3 has been shown to be crucial for normal placentation in humans and normal development of craniofacial bones and teeth in mice.\n\nIn addition to JAK-STAT, IL-11 also activate the Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B pathways. In response to IL-11, GTP loaded Ras interacts with RAF1 and leads to autophosphorylation of RAF1. Activation of RAF1 leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) through MEK1 and MEK2. Activation of phospholipase D was triggered by IL-11 leading to the formation of phosphatidic acid, which has also been shown to activate the MAPKs. Transcription factors, ATF1 and CREB1 were activated by these phosphorylated MAPKs through p90 S6 kinase. PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B/p65 pathways stimulated by IL-11 have been shown to enhance the migration and proliferation of chondrosarcoma cells. In CD4+ T cells, Th2 polarization was induced by IL-11 through NF-kappa B inhibition. SRC, FYN and YES, members of Src family of tyrosine kinases were also activated in response to IL-11 signalling.\n\nPlease access this pathway at [NetSlim](http://www.netpath.org/netslim/IL_11_pathway) database.\n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2332)"

    "pathwayDescription": "Hematopoietic Stem Cells found in bone marrow can differentiate into Monocytes and Erythrocytes, or in the case of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), they can continue to proliferate, undifferentiated, in blood. CML is caused by the Philadelphia translocation (Ph), which puts ABL behind BCR. The BRC-ABL fusion is a constitutively on tyrosine kinase that indirectly counteracts erythroid differentiation, thus promoting the continued proliferation underlying CML. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that binds ABL and in turn promotes healthy erythroid differentiation by counteracting BRC-ABL activity. Imatinib resistance can be conferred by the over-expression of ABC drug transporters and competitive binding kinases.\n\n\nThe pathway diagram above aligns molecules with the cell fates they promote, to help keep track of inhibition-of-inhibition-of-inhibition sequences, for example. The known mechanisms of imatinib resistance are at the bottom, under CML cell fate and are shown interacting with imatinib, which is under the erythrocyte cell fate. \n\nProteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [CPTAC Assay Portal](https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3640)."

    "pathwayDescription": "The Ebola virus (EBOV) pathway represents the virus infection on humans, depicted from the left to the right of the picture. The initial targets are macrophages and dendritic cells, but the virus has tropism to infect all kinds of cells, with the exception of lymphocytes. Here we represent all cells in general within one diagram.\nEbola attaches to the plasma membrane and after that, a viral glycoprotein induces penetration by endocytosis. This process is made by membrane proteins. During the penetration, its particles travel in compartments where viral glycoproteins are cleaved and fused to the endosomal membrane, which results in the uncoating of viral particles into the cell's cytoplasm. The virus then begins replicating and down-regulating the host's immune response. During the release process, the newly-created viruses are released from host cells, either by causing them to break apart, by waiting for their death, or by budding off through their membrane. Depending on the type of infected cell some trans-infection could happen. \n\nThis pathway was built using a text-mining approach to obtain interactions between genes related to this process. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive pathway depicting the Ebola pathway to date."

    "pathwayDescription": "Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) is divided into six subtypes of the disease. It is not known yet which gene is mutated to cause FPLD type 1. Type 2 is caused by mutations in lamin A, which can be either through LMNA mutations or ZMPSTE24 mutations. Type 3 has been shown to be linked to PPARG mutations. The LIPE gene causes triacylglycerol breakdown. Mutations in this gene lead more breakdown and causes type 6 FPLD. CIDEC inhibits LIPE. Mutations in CIDEC lead to type 5 FPLD. PLIN1 stimulates CIDEC and mutations in this leads to type 4 FPLD. \n\nThe phenotype related to all types of FPLD, is a loss of adipose tissue in the limbs and some metabolic abnormalities. With FPLD type 1 there is a loss of subcutaneous fat from the limbs. Patients with type 2 have an increased muscularity and a loss of fat in the limbs. There is also an accumulation of fat in the face and neck. In type 3 there is a loss of adipose tissue in the distal part of the limbs. Type 4 patients have shown to have small adipocytes, macrophage infiltration and fibrosis of adipose tissue. In type 5, there are small compartments in lipid droplets. Lastly, type 6 FPLD shows an increased visceral fat, hepatosteatosis, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Some patients may show muscular dystrophy and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase"

    "pathwayLink": "https://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP5108",
    "pathwayDescription": "Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification. Type 1 of this classification is linked to a decrease of LPL, either through mutations on the gene itself or because of other factors. LPL hydrolyzed triglycerides in chylomicrons and in very low-density lipoproteins. Type 1 familial hyperlipidemia shows an increase of chylomicrons. LPL normally hydrolizes these chylomicrons into chylomicron remnants. However, mutations in LPL have been shown to be the cause of the first form of type 1 hyperlipidemia. In tissue, LMF1 causes proper folding and assembly of LPL, which is stabalized by Sel1L. LPL is then transported to the endothelial cell surface of the capillary lumen, where it binds to GPIHBP1. APOC2 is essential for LPL activation, which is stabalized by APOA5. Studies have found another form of LPL activity, but with an increased amount of LPL inhibitors. These inhibitors are ANGPTL3,4 and 8. Which of these are inhibiting LPL depends on the tissue the LPL is in."

    "pathwayDescription": "In decidual NK (dNK) cells, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) interact with HLA-C allotypes on extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells to modulate immune responses at the maternal\u2013fetal interface. Inhibitory KIRs transmit signals through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases to suppress activation pathways. Conversely, activating KIRs signal via the adaptor protein DAP12, whose ITAM motifs recruit SYK kinase, leading to downstream activation of LAT, SLP-76, VAV1, PLC-\u03b31, and NF-\u03baB. This cascade promotes cytokine production and functional activation of dNK cells.\nAdditionally, KIR signaling has been linked to repeated pregnancy loss (RPL), suggesting coordination between immune signaling and placental development mediated by dNK cells. The exact origin of dNK cells (phenotype CD56\u207a\u207a (bright) CD16\u207b) is still uncertain. Some studies suggest they may arise from CD34\u207a progenitor cells, while others propose that peripheral blood NK (pbNK) cells or local NK precursors give rise to uterine NK (uNK) cells. These uNK cells may then differentiate into either endometrial NK (eNK) cells, which are present before pregnancy, or decidual NK (dNK) cells, which appear during early pregnancy."
