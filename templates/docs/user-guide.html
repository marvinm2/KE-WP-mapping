<h2>User Guide</h2>

<p>This guide walks you through the complete mapping workflow, from selecting Key Events to submitting high-quality mappings.</p>

<h3>Creating a New Mapping</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Select Key Event</h4>
<p>Use the searchable dropdown to find a Key Event from AOP-Wiki. You can search by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Key Event ID (e.g., "KE 55")</li>
    <li>Key Event title or keywords</li>
</ul>
<p>After selecting a KE, a details panel appears showing the KE description, biological level, and a link to measurement methods on AOP-Wiki. A context panel also loads showing AOP membership and any existing WP/GO mappings.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Select WikiPathway(s) — KE-WP Mapping</h4>
<p>Choose one or two related WikiPathways using the <strong>KE-WP Mapping</strong> tab. The system provides three sub-tabs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Suggested</strong> - Ranked pathway recommendations based on text similarity and gene overlap</li>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> - Search for pathways by name or keywords</li>
    <li><strong>Browse All</strong> - Browse all available WikiPathways</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2 (alternative): Select GO Term — KE-GO Mapping</h4>
<p>To map a KE to a Gene Ontology Biological Process term, use the <strong>KE-GO Mapping</strong> tab. The system suggests GO BP terms based on gene overlap and semantic similarity, displayed as suggestion cards with GO term name, definition, matched genes, and similarity scores.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Confidence Assessment (4 Questions)</h4>
<p>Answer four questions to evaluate mapping quality:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Question</th>
        <th>Options</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1. Relationship Type</td>
        <td>Causative / Responsive / Bidirectional / Unclear</td>
        <td>Determines connection direction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2. Evidence Basis</td>
        <td>Known / Likely / Possible / Uncertain</td>
        <td>Your confidence level (0-3 points)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3. Pathway Specificity</td>
        <td>KE-specific / Includes KE / Loosely related</td>
        <td>Pathway scope evaluation (0-2 points)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4. KE Coverage</td>
        <td>Complete / Key steps / Minor aspects</td>
        <td>Pathway completeness (0-1.5 points)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h4>Confidence Scoring</h4>
<p>The system calculates confidence based on your answers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>High Confidence</strong>: ≥5.0 points (strong evidence + good coverage)</li>
    <li><strong>Medium Confidence</strong>: 2.5-4.9 points (moderate evidence or limitations)</li>
    <li><strong>Low Confidence</strong>: <2.5 points (weak evidence or poor coverage)</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
    <strong>Biological Level Weighting:</strong> Molecular, cellular, and tissue-level KEs receive a +1 bonus point because they're closer to pathway mechanisms than organ/population-level KEs.
</div>

<div class="info-box">
    <strong>KE-GO Assessment:</strong> KE-GO mapping has its own confidence assessment with GO-specific connection types. The assessment evaluates the biological relevance of the KE-to-GO-term relationship.
</div>

<h3>Exploring Existing Mappings</h3>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Explore</strong> to view all mappings in an interactive table with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sorting and filtering capabilities</li>
    <li>Export to CSV, Excel, PDF formats</li>
    <li>Proposal system for suggesting changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Proposing Changes</h3>
<p>If you notice an issue with an existing mapping:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Login with GitHub</li>
    <li>Click "Propose Change" on the mapping</li>
    <li>Describe your proposed change</li>
    <li>Submit for admin review</li>
</ol>
